            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrang, that one of ſo low a name, and as low deſert (eſpecially being ſo far gone towards the Sunſet of his day here below) ſhould now in this preſs-oppreſſing Age, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard himſelf thus upon the publike ſtage, I hope, I may ſpeak it in truth: it is not any itching deſire to be ſeen in
<pb facs="tcp:121171:3"/> print, that hath prevailed with me to make this adventure. The great Motive was this. Sundrie of my worthy freinds both Miniſters, and private Chriſtians (which conceive a better opinion of me, than I doe of my ſelf) have ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their deſires, that I would leave ſomething behind me, before I ſhall goe hence and be no more, which might conduce to the building up of my hearers in their moſt holy faith, and obedience. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, comming from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hands, and ſo frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, after along time of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb facs="tcp:121171:3"/> debating it within mine owne breſt, I inclined to think it might be the call of God. VVhereupon I reſolved to make choice of ſome fit ſubject, to handle in mine ordinarie miniſtration at home; and having pitched upon this, and brought it to a period by the good hand of God upon me (notwithſtanding many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions), I ſhall now ſend it forth, to ſhift for it ſelf in the crowd. I have no reaſon to account it any thing worth, as it commeth from me. I freely acknowledg, that I fail very much in the manner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?
<pb facs="tcp:121171:4"/> yet the Argument it ſelf is of ſpecial neceſſity, and worth, touching upon the three maine Pillars, or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſtian Religion. <hi>viz.</hi> Mans miſerie by the fall, his Recoverie by Chriſt, and his Duty, ariſing thereupon. If the Lord be pleaſed to give it favour in the eyes of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to make it uſefull to raiſe the price of the grace of Redemption in the hearts of thoſe that heard it, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to engage them more ſtrongly to the love, and ſervice of their dear redeemer, I have my whole deſire.</p>

Although I am a man of a mean parentage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the world, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a ſtranger to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet you received me as a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and have ſhewed forth a tender

            <p>How much your Lordſhip hath deſerved of this Nation, by managing the militarie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of it, to the apparent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of your eſtate, health, and life too, is ſo famouſly known to all, that I am willing to hope, that this age (although other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unthankfull enough)
<pb facs="tcp:121171:5"/> cannot ſo eaſily forget it, as not to ſend down the memorie of it to poſteritie.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:121171:12"/> prefix it to this diſcourſe, if it may be an inducement unto any one to read it.</p>
            <p>The Authour (concerning whom my affectionate eſteem will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to be wholly ſilent) is a perſon of long ſtanding in the faith, and much experience in the things of Chriſt, now paſſing the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his age, and about the forty fifth year of his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And having well-nigh fulfilled the dayes of our yeares, which are ſaid to be Threeſcore and ten,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.10.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within ſight of Eternitie, he hath ſet before his eye the infinite obligations of eternal Redemption, and not thought it ſufficient to ſerve his own generation, by preaching the Goſpel, but hath been perſwaded to leave this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Love as a Legacy to the
<pb facs="tcp:121171:12"/> generation to come, that the people yet to be borne, may know, and praiſe their Redeemer. The work, thou haſt in thine hand, is the fruit of a well-grown tree, that brings forth fruit in its old age, and though the leaves and branches thereof, may not be ſo ſeemingly fair, and luxuriant, as ſome younger plants do afford, yet taſte of the fruit, and thou ſhalt finde it of good reliſh, ſound, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It grew indeed in a cold Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Climate, which men think, brings little to perfection; but it had the advantage of a warme heart, which is the beſt ſoil, and the beames of the ſonne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for the ripening of it. If any ſay, It is a common Subject, let him remember,<note place="margin">Titus 1.4.</note> that it is <hi>Common Faith,</hi> and <hi>Common Salvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iude 3.</note> and
<pb facs="tcp:121171:13"/> muſt be known by more then a common knowledge. It's plain indeed, as being reached, not to Curioſity, but to Conſcience; but plain work, clean wrought, is very commendable, and many times, where is moſt of Art; there is leaſt of Uſe. Yet it is not ſo plain, but the lines and engravings of the Holy Ghoſt may be diſcerned in it, by an eye well enlightened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and although, the Treatiſe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended mainly for Practiſe, yet our reverend Authour like a wiſe, and vigilant builder, hath (as the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of theſe times require) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on his work with a weapon on the one hand,<note place="margin">Neh. 4.17.</note> and a working In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the other, defending the Truth againſt its adverſaries, as well as recommending its fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:121171:13"/>
            <p>Let it not therefore be grievous to thee, for it is ſafe for thee (Chriſtian Reader) to retire a little from the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Contentions of this pretending Age, to a ſerious Conſideration of this moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and weighty ſubject.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:121171:26"/> habitation; ſome of them coming into theſe parts, and lighting upon a countrey which bordered upon <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> ſate down there, and called it (in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their firſt Original) <hi>Galatia,</hi> ſee 1 Pet. 1.1.</p>
               <p>Who was the firſt that preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel among them, and was the inſtrument to reduce them from their Gentiliſme to the faith, and profeſſion of Chriſt, whether it was S. <hi>Paul</hi> or ſome other of the Apoſtles, as it is not eaſie to determine, ſo neither is it neceſſary for us to know. This is certain; 1. That there were Churches planted in that region, chap. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 16.1. 2. That <hi>Paul</hi> and his companions travelling through thoſe parts, were forbidden to preach the word in <hi>Aſia,</hi> Act. 16.6. Yet, 3. That he preached the Goſpel unto them in his ovvn perſon, ſee chap. 1.8.11. and 4.13. (probably at that time vvhen he paſſed through that region, before the inhibition came to him) and 4. That after all this, he vvent over that countrey again, and ſtrengthened all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples in the truth of the Goſpel, vvhich they had received, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.23.</p>
               <p>But as it often fell out, that the Churches began too ſoon to degenerate, and decline from their primitive purity:<note n="*" place="margin">Vergere in pejus.</note> ſo theſe Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians vvere quickly removed from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel, by the inſtigation of the falſe Apoſtles, preſſing a neceſſity of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and the obſervation of the Lavv of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be joyned vvith Chriſt unto ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:121171:26"/> and ſalvation. And to the end they might the more eaſily prevail, thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful vvorkers vvent about to ſlight, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe the authority of the Apoſtle by all means poſſible.</p>
               <p>Upon this occaſion he ſends them this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, vvherein (after the inſcription) he chides them ſharply for their Apoſtaſie; then he aſſerts the truth of his doctrine, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Apoſtleſhip; for the clearing vvhereof, he ſets dovvn the ſtory of his life paſt, both in his Judaiſme and Chriſtianiſme: After vvhich, he ſets upon the main buſineſs, to maintain the doctrine of juſtification by faith alone, vvhich he proſecutes in this chapter, and the next; adding thereunto, an earneſt exhortation to ſtand faſt in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual liberty, and to the practiſe of other Chriſtian duties of ſpeciall concernment, and ſo concludes.</p>
               <p>We ſhall fetch the coherence no higher, then from the 6 verſe of this chapter. The hinge of his diſputation runs upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>We are juſtified by faith alone, without the works of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make the proof more clear and full, he brings Arguments both for the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and for the Negative.</p>
               <p>The Affirmative part is, <hi>We are juſtified by faith alone:</hi> To prove this, he layes down tvvo Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Dravvn from the example of <hi>Abraham;</hi> look by vvhat vvay or means <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father vvas juſtified, by the ſame are all his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:121171:27"/> children juſtified, but he was <hi>juſtified by faith alone:</hi> Ergo ver. 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Drawn from Gods mind touching this, made known beforehand, Look how the Scripture chalks out Gods way of juſtifying the Gentiles in aftertimes, that way they are juſtified, but faith in Chriſt is the way which it hath chalked out, <hi>Ergo</hi> ver. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>The Negative part is, <hi>We are not juſtified at all by the works of the Law;</hi> and for this alſo he brings two Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Drawn from the ſentence of the Law it ſelf. If the Law it ſelf do ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a curſe upon all that depend upon it, then juſtification is not by the works of the Law: for if it juſtifie it bleſſeth: if it curſe, how doth it juſtifie? but the Law doth ſo pronounce, <hi>Ergo</hi> ver. 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Drawn from the inconſiſtence of theſe two, the Law and faith. Its onely by faith that the ſinner is juſtified, and ſo lives; but the Law is not of faith. Theſe two in the buſineſſe of juſtification flie aſunder, and cannot ſtand together; even as grace and works do in the decree of election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Ergo</hi> ver. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Now whether theſe words be intended for a new argument,<note n="*" place="margin">Summum et potentiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, <hi>Jun. Paral.</hi>
                  </note> or onely for an amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſomething before delivered, is doubtful; if the former, then the ground of the argument muſt be the near connexion of Redemption and Juſtification, thus,</p>
               <p>If Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, then we are not juſtified by the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:121171:27"/> works of it: for if Juſtification may be had by the Law, then there is no need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt; ſo the Apoſtle reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, chap. 2. <hi>But Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>But I rather chuſe to take it for an amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that, ver. 10. concerning the curſe of the Law (although to our purpoſe it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not, whether way we take it) by way of prevention of an objection. Some might ſay, if that be ſo indeed, that the Law doomes all men accurſed, which do not keep it; then we are all in a wofull caſe<note n="*" place="margin">Magna vox: Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo igitur ſanab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mur? <hi>Olevian. in Loc.</hi>
                  </note>; for none of us are able to keep it; therfeore the Law having pronounced us accurſed, we are accurſed with a witneſſe, paſt help &amp; remedy, &amp; then your doctrine of Juſtification proves a bootleſſe thing. Not ſo, ſaith the Apoſtle: for although by the ſentence of the Law, we lie under the curſe, yet we are not therefore helpleſſe; for Jeſus Chriſt hath wrought our redemption, diſanulled the curſe, and reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from it, and ſo hath laid a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work for Juſtification by himſelf alone, and eternall bleſſedneſſe thereby, as v. 14.</p>
               <p>I may call my Text a ſacred Oracle, or a Divine Axiom, holding forth the great work of Redemption by Chriſt. Obſerve in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The miſerable eſtate of mankind, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>under the curſe of the Law.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Or thus. Three main Truths are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to our view.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What we are in our ſelves, <hi>under the curſe of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What Chriſt is made for us: <hi>a curſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. What good he hath procured for us thereby; <hi>he hath redeemed us from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we have here three concluſions or Doctrines, which I ſhall propound, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute in their order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All men are under the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt was made a curſe for us, which are under the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt, by being made a curſe for us, hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law.</p>

                  <p>THe firſt Concluſion or Doctrine is this. All men are under the curſe of the Law. This is the condition of all mankind, as they ſtand ſince the fall, that they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the curſe of Gods Law.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall evidence this Truth by four Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. All men are under the Law; I ſpeak now of man in his firſt condition, and as he was made in <hi>Adam.</hi> God did ſet the firſt man, and all his poſterity with him, in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:121171:28"/> day of his Creation, under the authority and command of his own Law. We may look upon it under a double Notion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As a Platform of righteouſneſſe; and thus we were under it by conformity: the Law was written in mans heart; ſo much is implyed <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>God made man after his own image,</hi> Gen. 1.26. <hi>Which ſtandeth in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, righteouſneſſe, and holineſse of truth,</hi> Col. 3.11. Eph. 4.24. His mind, will, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and all being conformable to the mind of God, as the counterpart to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, As a rule of obedience; and ſo we were under it by ſubjection, As God beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man ſufficient ability to obey the Law, ſo likewiſe he tyed him to walk according to the preſcript thereof exactly. Man was not made<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Yea further, beſides the morall Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, God gave him a poſitive Law, reſtraining him from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, upon pain of death; and this was to ſerve both for the probation; and the manifeſtation of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Maker: I need not inſiſt longer on this propoſition, but ſhall take it for granted.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. All men have broken the Law; they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:121171:29"/> have ſwarved from this Platform, &amp; are gone aſide from this Rule. This muſt be branched out, and explained in three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our firſt Parents broke the Law, flew off from the holy commandment given to them, and ſo made an eſcape from God their Maſter. The ſtory is plain, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. which Solomon expreſſeth thus. Man hath found out many inventions, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.29. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> having a ſtrict charge given, not to eat of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> one tree, hearkened to the counſel of his wife, who was before bewitched and enſnared by Satan, ſpeaking to her in the Serpent. And although he had ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have repelled the temptation, and to have kept himſelf free, yet he willingly yielded, and withdrawing his heart from God, went croſſe to his charge. Being ſet in an eſtate of happineſſe, and honour, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved diſloyal, and departed away wantonly, and cauſleſly from the bleſſed God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to the creature, this was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful breach, being not one ſingle Iniquity, but a compound, or fardell of many, as Divines obſerve, eſpecially theſe 4.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Diſtruſt of God, giving credit rather to the falſe tales, and whiſperings of Satan, then to the word of the everliving God, and entertaining thoughts tending to queſtion, the realneſſe and ſincerity of his commands, promiſes, and threatnings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Unthankfulneſſe to God, who had ſet him in ſuch an excellent condition; but he playes the part of an ambitious diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p n="3">3. Rebellion againſt God, in going point blank againſt the commandment of God, adventuring upon that, which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden, not fearing the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but putting the Lord to it, and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, to ſee what he would do.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. We all broke the Law in them. We were all in <hi>Adams</hi> loyns, what he was, we were; what he did, we did. Although we did not in our own perſons, either talk with the Serpent, or put forth our hands to take the fruit, yet we did eat the forbidden fruit as well as he, and ſo broke the Law, and turned aſide in him: for he was not a ſingle perſon, ſtanding for himſelf alone, but a publick one, ſtanding in the room of all mankind: therefore his ſin, being not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſin of his perſon, but of the whole nature of man, is juſtly imputed to us all. If <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in his uprightneſſe, we ſhould have been partakers of the gains, he forfeiting all, we muſt ſhare with him in the loſſe. See <hi>Romans</hi> 5.12. <hi>In

He was the Tree, we the branches: when the tree falls, all the branches fall with it<note n="*" place="margin">Corruit, &amp; cuncti ſimul in genitore cadente, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruimus.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We do all actually break the Law in our own perſons, and that 2 wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. in the frame and diſpoſition of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are corrupt, filthy, crooked, wholly broken off, and turned aſide from conformity, and ſubjection to the Law. Our diſobedience in <hi>Adam</hi> draws along after it, a woful depravation of our natures; ſo that we are all bred and born tranſgreſſours, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.8. <hi>Adam</hi> begat a ſon in his own image, a ſinner like to himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. <hi>David</hi> in his penitentiall confeſſions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his grievous fall, bewails this, as the riſe of all the miſchief, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. This leproſie this poyſon, hath overſpred all mankind, and the whole nature of it; all ſorts, ſexes, ſtates, degrees, and not one free; and all the parts and powers of every man, in ſoul and body throughout. Our firſt Father being a corrupt tree, hath infuſed corruption into all the branches, and being a poyſoned foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, hath ſhed his poyſon into all the ſtreams flowing from him. Hence every man is born, not onely deſtitute of all goodneſſe, but alſo wholly averſe from it: not onely prone to all evil, but alſo full of it, as a Toad

                  <p n="2">2. in the courſe and practiſe of our lives: we do according to our kind; the bad tree brings forth bad fruit, the corrupt ſpring brings forth unwholſome waters; if the powers or habits be depraved, the operations and actings which proceed from them can be no better<note n="*" place="margin">Laeſae fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultates, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae actiones. <hi>Prov. 21.4</hi>

Theſe and ſuch like are the ſparks which do dayly fly out of the helliſh furnace of our wofull natures, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.6. And thus much of the ſecond propoſition.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. All men are found guilty of ſin by the light, and verdict of the Law. The Law of God is a right line, which at once diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers what is ſtraight and what is crooked.<note n="⸫" place="margin">Index ſui, &amp; obliqui.</note> As it ſhews unto man what is good, and what the Lord requires of him, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. ſo when man hath ſwarved, and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it ſhews him his contrary evil, and chargeth him with doing that which he ought not to have done. It's a glaſſe, which might both let him ſee his native beauty (if he had any) and his deformity, and ſpots, which he hath brought upon himſelf. It's a finger, which both points at the right way, and diſcovers to the traveller the wrong way. As it is in humane Laws, the very ſame Statute that forbids treaſon, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth alſo (when any of theſe facts are committed) charge them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Actours; and the ordinary Rule, and Warrant, to proceed by in trying the parties is this, or that Statute or Law of the land: ſo it is in the Law of God; it hath a voice, whereby it can cry aloud to the conſcience of the ſinner, and tell him, This is a miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and that is a miſcarriage, for which thou muſt anſwer. Thus it was with our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:121171:31"/> as it may very probably be inferred from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. And yet it is not materiall (as to the truth, and authentickneſſe of the verdict) whether the ſinner ſee this light, and hear this voice, or not: the Sun ſends forth his light, although all the world were blind: the candle will ſhine, although all in the room were aſleep, ſo the righteous Law of God, cryes out of violence and wrong, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſinners be deaf, and cannot hear it; and chargeth them with iniquity, although they (wretched ſouls) be ſo blockiſh that they will take no notice of it. In brief, the Law chargeth all the world to be under ſin, and guilty before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9.19. Thus of the third Propoſition.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. All men being found guiltie by the verdict of the Law, doe therefore ſtand accurſed by the doome of the ſame Law: for there is a neceſſarie connexion betwixt guilt, and curſe. If Adam, and his poſteritie be juſtly chargeable with ſin againſt the Law, then are they alſo juſtly liable to the Curſe of the Law; for the Law breaths out a curſe againſt all the ſonnes and daughters of Adam, and claps it on their backs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſinn; ſo that they are all under the curſe, even the curſe of Almightie God revealed, and expreſſed in the Law</p>
                  <p>To cleare this further, let us look upon it. 1. in the ſentence. 2. in the execution of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the ſentence. This is the voice of the Lord, ſounding out in the Law, which both threatens it to the tranſgreſſours, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:121171:32"/> them to be accurſed. The Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the curſe againſt all ſinners in the Name of the Lord: it tells Adam, and his poſteritie that they are accurſed: it ſaith to every one in particul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thou man, thou woman, art accurſed. ſe <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.15.16. <hi>&amp;c. Gen.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.21.

                  <p n="2">2. In the exicution; as the Law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, and denounceth the curſe, ſo the Lawgiver ſtrikes the ſinner accordingly. Look what the Law ſpeakes, the Lawgiver makes good; he executes (by his own hand, or by his inſtruments) the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment written, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.9. As the juſt judge on earth executes the ſentence paſſed upon the Malefactor, according to the Law: ſo doth the Lord, the Judge of all the world; he inflicts the curſe, which the Law awards, in ſuch manner, and meaſure, as he pleaſeth; thus he curſed Adam, when he had ſinned. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. and he is ſaid to bring curſes on a people, and to give a people to the curſe, and to make them to be an Execration. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.6. &amp; 43.28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.18. and the curſe is ſaid to be powred upon men. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.11.</p>

                  <p>BUt it may be worth the labour, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more particularly, what this Curſe is, and wherein it ſtands: we may expreſſe it thus.</p>
                  <p>It is the abandoning of the ſinner from God, and ſo from all happineſs, and the throwing of him downe into the folds of his wrath, and ſo into all miſerie we read <hi>Joſ.</hi> 6. of the accurſed thing. * God laid a curſe on the ſpoile of <hi>Jericho,</hi> that is, devoted it to utter deſtructions,<note n="⸫" place="margin">Ver. 17, 18</note> * giving a ſtrict charge that no man ſhould meddle with it, upon paine of being accurſed, and devoted to deſtruction himſelf, which was accordingly executed upon <hi>Achan.</hi> chap. 7. Truly, ſinne is that Accurſed thing; there is nothing in all the world ſo accurſed, as ſinne, and whoſoever meddles with it, God from heaven pronounceth that man accurſed, and devotes him to the uttermoſt of his wrath, even to eternall deſtruction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. God is bleſſed, yea bleſſedneſſe it ſelf; therefore the bleſſedneſſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt needs ſtand in the enjoying of God, and ſo of all good in him: contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the curſedneſſe of the creature ſtands in its being caſt off from God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently implunged into his diſpleaſure, and the greateſt miſery. It is ſet forth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:121171:33"/> by darkneſſe; for God is light, and to be ſeparated from him, is to be compaſſed with black darkneſſe: ſometimes by death, as in the threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. for he is life, and to be removed from him, is to dwell in the very ſhadow of death. Thus did the Lord curſe <hi>Adam</hi> after his ſin, <hi>q. d.</hi> Seeing thou haſt a mind to depart from me, be it ſo, I do abandon thee out of my preſence, be gone from me; Thou art accurſed, and accurſed thou ſhalt be; and to ſeal up this ſentence, he thruſts him out of Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.24.</p>
                  <p>Now this Curſe (even as the ſin) hath ſpred, and derived it ſelf to all his poſterity, ſo that all are accurſed in, and with him. And that we may view it more fully, let us conſider it in the parts, as it lies. 1. On the body. 2. On the ſoul. 3. On both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The curſe on the body ſhews it ſelf mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, 1. Birth. 2. Life. 3. Death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A miſerable birth, attended with pain and ſorrow, both to mother and child: the mother cries, the child weeps: there is a curſe in the begetting, conceiving, bearing in the wombe, and bringing forth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. the curſe is derived to us, and deſcends upon us all from the loins of our fathers, and the wombs of our Mothers, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.18. it takes hold upon us, and is in force againſt us as ſoon as ever we have a being.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A miſerable life: the Curſe attends us, and goes along with us, during our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance here: in our perſons, names, eſtates,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:121171:33"/> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and in all that ever we either do or ſuffer. The poyſon and power of it breaks forth, either, 1. In infflicting on us poſitive evils, as on our perſons, ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, deformity, weakneſſe, toilſome labours, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.21, 22, 27, 60. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, croſſes, loſſes, plunderings, poverty, ver. 16.17.—31, 32.—51, 52. on our names, diſgrace, reproach, ver. 37. on our callings, and all our wayes, ver. 20.29.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A miſerable death: the body is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually murling away, and old age it ſelf taſts deeply of this bitter cup. For although the hoary head be a crown of glory, yet that is no thanks to it ſelf; its onely when its found in the way of righteouſneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.31. ſtill the ſinner of an hundred years old, ſhall be accurſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.20. We are all of the duſt, and ſhall at length return to it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.48. The body, by its union to the ſoul, enjoyed life; but by ſeparation it becomes a liveleſſe carkaſſe. This ſeparation is a curſe; not onely in it ſelf, but alſo 1. in the manner of it; for its a parting of two old friends, and uſually is done with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:121171:34"/> and painfulnes, as if you would rend an arme from the bodie, or pluck the heart out of the bellie. 2. In the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of it, the bodie muſt lie in the grave, and rott there. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.14. ſo that now the ſinner hath no more place in the land of the living; a full period is put to all his earthly contentments, and ſometimes he leaves his name for a curſe to poſteritie. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.15. and it rotts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. But oh! all this is nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that curſe, which falls upon the ſoule. I ſhall reduce the things which appertaine to this head, to 3 particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An utter forfeiture of the ſpecial ſweet favour of God, even in this life, together with a wofull ſubjection unto his hot diſpleaſure. We may ſuppoſe the Lord ſpeakes thus to our firſt Father, and in him to us all, you had my favour, my countenance was towards you, I embraced you once with loving kindnes, and you were happie in it; and if you had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in your obedience, you might have continued in my love, and I would ſtill have compaſſed you about with my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: but ſeeing you have ſet it ſo light, you ſhall have no more of it, you ſhall know, how you come by it hereafter, yea the fire of mine indignation ſhall ſmoke againſt you to the uttermoſt: ye were once my <hi>Hephzibah,</hi> a choſen generation, the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved of my ſoule: now ye are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:121171:34"/> a ſmoke in my noſtrils, the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my wrath, and a people againſt whome, the Lord will have indignation for ever. Thus we are all ſtruck dead, with the loſſe of Gods favour, and plunged o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver head, and eares in the ſea of his dreadfull diſpleaſure. We are deprived of that, which is better than life, and filled brim-full of that, which is worſe than death, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An utter loſſe of the faire pure image of God, which was put upon us in the day of our Creation, and in ſtead of that a putting on us the foule black image of the Divel, and ſinne. We may ſuppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Lord ſpeakes thus. I created thee after mine own image, I did put upon thee the ſtampe of the divine nature, in wiſdome, righteouſnes, and holineſe of truth: but ſeeing thou waſt ſo farre from taking care to preſerve it, that thou didſt wantonly caſt filth upon it: therefore I doe remand it from thee, it ſhall no longer abide in that baſe unworthie ſoule of thine: henceforth let that ugly image of ſinne, and hell, which (it ſeemes) pleaſeth thee better, ſeize upon thee; take it to thee, and fils thy ſelf with it. Thus we are all alienated from the life of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. This part of the curſe lyes heavie on the whole ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. On the Mind, and underſtanding part: which is impotent, and unable to conceive the things of God, and to diſcerne
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:121171:35"/> of things that differ, our underſtandings are darkened. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. ſee. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. On the Conſcience, which is defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. being either ſenſles, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing, when it ſhould accuſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. or when awaked, wanting juſt matter of excuſing, and ſo unpeaceable. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. On the will, which is rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, and wayes of God revealed to the mind, depraved in its power of chuſing, can will onely, that which is evil, cannot will that which is good. ſee <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Math.</hi> 23.37.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. On the affections, which (being the Wills Waiting-Maids) are of the ſame temper, diſordered, affecting evil, diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting good, running into extremitie of exceſſe, or defect, and ſo ſpoyling the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Thus man, once made upright, yet by ſeeking out many inventions, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.29. is become without God in the world. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. ergo accurſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the ſoule, and body are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then the wretched ſoule is ſent down to hell, to take poſſeſſion of thoſe everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames. As ſoone as ever the firſt death hath done its office, forthwith the doome of the ſecond death paſſeth upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſoule, and then the great Jaylour of hell layeth hold upon it, and drags it into the preſence of the Almighty, on whom it ſhall look, with horror and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazment. Thy now ſleeping conſcience ſhall then be awakened, and all thy ſinnes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:121171:35"/> ſhall be ſet in order before thee, thou wilt not ſee them now, but they ſhall then ſtare in thy face; yea thy ſecret ſinnes ſhall be ſet in the light of Gods countenance, and thy moſt pleaſing iniquities ſhall appeare before thee in their proper black hiew, to gaſter thy ſoule into finall deſperation. No place left for repentance; the doore of mercie, and the gate of heaven, ſhall be thenceforth ſhut up againſt thee for ever; thy wretched ſoul muſt take up its lodging in the lothſome priſon of hell with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and his Angels; <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22, 23. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. where it ſhall lie, filled with the wrath of God for the preſent aſtoniſhed, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up with the apprehenſion of the eternitie of that to come, and tremblingly waiting for the great day of reckoning, and the dreadfull houre, when it ſhall be poured downe in full vials upon the whole man.</p>

All the hoſts of heaven and earth, are readie even like to rebell againſt us. This is a curſe, which all the ſonnes, and daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> feele in ſome meaſure, and ſometimes reacheth to the taking away of life, limbe, and all comforts. And although the ſinner enjoy the benefit of the creatures both for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, and delight, yet that is onely by the indulgence of the moſt High, who makes his Sun to ſhine, and his raine to fall upon all: and the choiceſt enjoyments are but as the Accommodations afforded to a Traitour in the Tower; there's a deadly

Hence we may be bold to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, without the leaſt haeſitation or doubting, that Mankinde is not now in that condition, wherein it was at firſt created. For Mankinde is under the curſe of God, and of the Law: but certainly God did not create man accurſed in the beginning: No ſuch work could poſſibly come out of the hands of the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who is God bleſſed for ever. Oh no, God made him a bleſſed creature, his poſteritie with and him, putting upon him, ſome parcels of his own bleſſednes.

And ſaid, Oh man, I have ſet the ſtampe of mine own image upon thee, and thou art a bleſſed creature by that bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I have put upon thee. The Law looked upon him, and ſaw him every way
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:121171:38"/> conformable to it ſelf, and ſaid, Oh man, I can find no flaw in thee, therefore I bleſſe thee in the Name of the Lord.

Did not I ſowe the ſeed of bleſſedneſs in this feild? how comes it then, to be ſo full of curſed tares? oh, the Enemie hath done this. As, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.27.28. Thus man is wofully flitted from the top of Mount <hi>Gerizon,</hi> to the topp of Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> and is quite another, than God made him; as farr differing from what he was once, as curſing is from bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>Oh, conſider this; look back, and ſee what we have been.

They were all made to ſerve thee, but now, that thou art a convicted Rebell, and therefore accurſed by the doome of the Law, they all fare worſe for thy ſake; the curſe reflects upon them, becauſe of thy treaſon againſt God: even as when a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is found a Traitour, and ſo obnoxious to the Law, all his ſervants, and retayners are ſharers with him (leſſe or more) in his ſufferings.</p>

Indeed they ſpitt at him, and ſay, they defie him; yet nevertheleſſe they are his drudges, and carry his pack, and doe his worke.

As ſometimes a father ſaith of an hopeleſs child: Seeing he will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed, let him take his courſe, let him run himſelf out of breath, and haſten to his owne ruine. Thus he ſcourged the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles for their wilde courſes againſt the light of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26.28.

Thus the Lord deales with many of the ſecure ſleepie ſinners: they give no regard to the offer of mercie, therefore the Lord ſhutts them up in ignorance, and ſaith, let him, that is ignorant, filthy, carnall, be ſo ſtill: they are not bettered by mercies, or judgments, therefore they ſhall be made worſe. The cloſe deceiver becomes a groſſe robber, and God gives him over to lying, ſwearing, forſwearing, &amp;c. The immoderate uſe of the creatures becomes groſly riotous; God gives him up to beaſtly drunkenneſs, miſpending of his time, waſting his eſtate, yea ſometimes to wantonneſs, and bodily filthyneſs, to hatred yea ſcorning of good counſel, and the like abhominable practices.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:121171:42"/> It hath a ſuperſcription, and ſtampe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine warrant upon it: the power of heaven goes along with it, which puts weight upon it, and makes it heavie and bitter. <hi>Eliſha</hi> curſed the mocking children in the name of the Lord, and that curſe commiſſioned, and enraged the 2 ſhe beares to teare them in pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.23.24.

All the inhabitants of the world being accurſed through ſinne, it's a wonder, that the firſt, and ſecond death have not fallen pel-mel upon them all, and devoured them at once: its a wonder, that the curſe hath not daſhed us all to peices, and brought the whole world into a Chaos long agoe. This is from the wiſe, and good providence of God, who for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole frame, and for the comfort of his owne people, doth ſnub, reſtraine, and moderate the curſe, and keepes it within certaine bounders, as the Sea within its banks, that it cannot overflow, and deſtroy

                  <p n="4">4ly. Hence I inferre, that there is no juſtification to be had, no, nor any poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof by the works of the Law. It is a vaine thing once to expect it. The Law curſeth ſinners; how then doth it bleſs them? but if it juſtifie them, it bleſſeth them.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:121171:45"/> All men are under the curſe of the Law: therefore no man is under the acquittance, and abſolution of the Law. This is one of the Apoſtles arguments in the verſes before to look for juſtification, and bleſſing from the Law, is not onely to loſe our labour, but alſo to bring upon our ſelves more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif. Its the way to inwrappe us more in the folds of the curſe, to implunge us into a deeper Sea of guilt, yea to ſeale up the curſe againſt our owne ſoules, and to make it ſure to our ſelves. Obſerve, what is the concluſion, which the Apoſtle would prove, from the text alledged out of <hi>Deuteronomie. verſ.</hi> 10. before, It is, that thoſe, which are of the works of the Law, are under the curſe, that is, not onely thoſe, which break the Law, or doe not keep it perfectly, but thoſe that depend upon it, and reckon of juſtification by the works of it, even theſe alſo are accurſed, ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19.20.

As if he ſhould ſay, If I ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before Gods judgment-ſeat, clothed in that habit, he would abhorre me, and I were utterly undone. So then, there is no juſtification to be had by the Law; No
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:121171:46"/> man can poſſibly reach that conformitie to the Law of God, either inward, or outward, in the frame of the heart, or cariage of the life, which will be able to plead his juſtification in the ſight of God, It is not any good qualitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, or any goodwork, that comes from us, or both joyned together (though never ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for kind, or degree), that can ſet us right in the court of heaven. There is nothing at all, which a man hath, nothing at all, which he doth or can doe, for which God will pronounce him righteous: but when he hath done all, and is got up to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch, the Law will tell him to his face, that he is ſtill Accurſed. This is needfull to be urged: for not onely the world, but the churches of Chriſt, are full of juſtitiaries, which carve unto themſelvs an imaginary ſelf-righteouſneſs according to the Law. Oh that theſe perſons would open their eares to this truth, and take it down. Of theſe I obſerve 4 ſorts, I meane ſuch, as ſeek a Bleſſedneſs by the Law, which they ſhall never find.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Profeſſed Papiſts, which ſubmit unto, and hold faſt the eſtabliſh'd doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> eſpecially as it is ſet forth in the councell of <hi>Trent;</hi> where they determine thus. The alone formal cauſe of the Juſtification of a ſinner before God, or that which gives being to it, is Righteouſneſs implanted, or a new qualitie of grace, or frame of holines wrought in the ſoule: which what is it elſe, but perſonall, and inhaerent conformitie to the Law of God? They tell us further,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:121171:46"/> of a, firſt juſtification, whereby of unrighteous, a man is made righteous; and ſecondly, whereby of unrighteous, he is made more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. The former (if I miſtake not) they hold incompleat, and ſo inſufficient; being but a kind of entrance made by faith, and other preparative diſpoſitions: the latter is that, on which the maine waight of the buſineſs lies; and its done (ſay they) by the improovement, and exerciſe of thoſe good diſpoſitions, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law. So that a Papiſt, keeping to the principles of his religion, muſt either have his bleſſedneſs from the Law, or ſtand accurſed ſtill: and if we make the beſt of it, he is chargeable with that follie, for which the Apoſtle taxeth the <hi>Galathians. verſ.</hi> 3. Of beginning in the ſpirit, and ſeeking to be made perfect by the fleſh. And herein the hand of God is remarkeable, either in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or juſtice, or both, to ſome of them, in taking them off from their old plea, ſo that when they are to die, they dare not truſt their ſoules in ſo crazie a bottome: yea their great Champion <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> when he hath bett his braines, and ſtretched his wits, in ſundrie pages to uphold the doctrine of juſtification by inhaerent righteouſnes, yet at length he comes to this reſolve. * Becauſe of the uncertaintie of our owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the danger of vaine glorie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is * <hi>the ſafeſt way</hi> to truſt onely in the mercie and goodnes of God. In which words, he doth (upon the matter) unweave
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:121171:47"/> his owne webbe, and deſtroy what he had built. For if this be the ſafeſt way, it is ſo, becauſe it is Gods onely approoved way for the juſtification of a ſinner; and conſeq. this way alone muſt be taken, and all other wayes muſt be rejected, and avoided, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely not the ſafeſt, but poſitively unſafe, and certainly full of danger, yea, unqueſtionably deſtructive.</p>

They were baptiſed, they keep their church, they come to the communion, and receive their Maker (as they carnally, and groſly ſpeak), they have a ſhare in the outward priviledges of the church, ſaying, Lord, Lord, and therefore they think, that no blame lies upon them, the curſe is farre enough of from them, they are accepted of God, and in a bleſſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus the Jewes gloryed in the Temple of the Lord, which the Lord condemneth, as a truſting in lying words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4.

But oh wofull people, how came you by this bleſſedneſs? whence had you it? you are under the Law; it holds you under guilt, and pronounceth you accurſed; and (alas) theſe priviledges and ſervices are far too weak, and poor things to take off that guilt, and to remove that curſe which ſticks to your wretched ſouls.

But oh man, if thou wilt bring thy ſelf and thy work to the ſtandard, thou wilt finde, that although thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf, and others bleſs thee too, yet thou art without the ſun-ſhine of Gods bleſſing. For if it were granted, that thou haſt gone thorow-ſtitch in thy duty to men, yet ſtill the buſineſs is lame, and halts on a ſide; all this while thou haſt neglected thy duty to God, and doſt thou look to be accepted for thy partial obedience? would this be a ſufficient acquittance to a child in his fathers houſe, that he hath diſcharged himſelf well in all his carriage to his brethren, and ſervants in the family, while he hath never regarded his duty to his father? or can he expect his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bleſſing? may he not rather fear his curſe?

There is no wiſe man (I ſuppoſe) but would willingly be informed of any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that is towards him; if he be under the diſpleaſure of the ſupreme Power, or in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſome mortal diſeaſe; or if he fear an adverſary at Law, every one would know the worſt of his own cauſe: for he may poſſibly by this means be put into a way to prevent or avoid it, which otherwiſe (ordinarily) he cannot.

This is not a politick device of Preachers, or purpoſe to ſcrew into mens conſciences, that they may Lord it over them (as carnal men are apt to judge) but a way approved by God himſelf, in order to the converſion of ſinners, and ſeconded by the practice of his ſervants in former times. The Law is the Lords can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to reveal ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Its the Lords hand to work wrath in the ſoul, by ſtriking it with conviction, and with fear thereupon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. God the great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver hath put upon it ſuch a beam of purity and authority, that it is able to manifeſt ſin to the conſcience, even in the moſt ſlie and hidden aberrations. It's the Lords Bayliff, to hunt out ſin in the ſeveral kinds, degrees and colours of it, and to lay his arreſts upon the ſinner. It's the Lords voice, to call and fetch every <hi>Adam</hi> out of his thickets, Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:121171:51"/> yea, it's the Lords ſword, or ſlaughtering-knife, whereby he kills and ſlays the ſinner in himſelf, that he may live unto God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. Now that the Law may do all this, it is not enough that the ſinner have an overly and general knowledge of it, but it muſt be opened, and applied in ſome competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of diſtinctneſs to his heart and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for doubtleſs every natural man may ſay of the Law, as the Eunuch of the Text, in the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> How can I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, except ſome man ſhould guide me? <hi>Act.</hi> 8.31. God ſends <hi>Moſes</hi> to conduct the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> towards the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they muſt go thorow the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and there the Law muſt be promulgated in a terrible manner, with thundrings and lightnings, &amp;c. that the fear of the Lord might be before their faces, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.20. Sinners muſt come to mount <hi>Sinai</hi> before they come to mount <hi>Sion.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt himſelf when he comes with healing in his wings, and his heart and mouth full of bleſſing for ſinners; yet even then he will ſend his meſſenger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face to prepare the way before him; they muſt remember the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mean time, and before his coming he will ſend them one to go before him in the ſpirit and power of <hi>Elias,</hi> &amp;c. leſt he come and ſmite the earth with a curſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. So that (to ſhut up this uſe) we muſt crave your excuſe if we harp ſometimes on this harſh ſtring; for although it be not toothſome phyſick, yet it is wholſome. We

We were not worthy to be admitted Counſellors at Law, if we would not plainly tell our Clients the worſt of their cauſes. We know the terrour of the Lord, therefore we perſwade you by the light of the Law, to conſider of your miſery, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. That ſpeech of the Phariſees is a truth, though ill meant, and worſe applied by them <hi>John</hi> 7.49. The people which know not the Law, are curſed. When people cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear of their ſin, and curſe by the miniſtery of the Law, it is too probable a ſign that they lie faſt bound (hand and foot) under the curſe. Oh my brethren, were it not better to hear the curſe ringing aloud in your ears in this world, while there is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of eſcaping it, than to feel it lying on your ſouls and bodies, in the full power and fury of it in the world to come, when the time of mercy and bleſſing is expired; Oh conſider it, and the Lord give you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>

Review the ſad effects and ſtrange properties before mentioned, and then tell me, are you now convinced of your miſery? is it come ſo near to your conſciences, that you cannot now ſhake it off any longer? Oh then, I intreat you, for the love of your ſouls get from under it; how dare ye abide in this condition? how can ye eat or drink, or ſleep with ſuch a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie weighty curſe lying upon your ſouls? Say, Oh wretch that I am, I was born at firſt to bleſſedneſs, but I am now implunged into a moſt wofull curſe; and ſhall I lie ſtill under it, and not go about to recover my firſt eſtate? Oh no, haſte away, and eſcape for thy life; the longer thou continueſt under the curſe, the more ſinfulneſs and guilt thou contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt, and ſo makeſt thy ſelf more accurſed.

                  <p n="2">2. To parents, and ſuch as have the charge of others; alas, your children are under the curſe of the Law. Suppoſe that ſome of them were infected with the leproſie, peſtilence, or any contagious diſeaſe threatening death; or were under any calamity at preſent, which would certainly be their ruine, if not timely prevented, would ye not uſe the beſt means for their help? eſpecially if your hearts can tell you, that you have had a great hand in bringing them into this danger?

Do ye not tremble to think, into what a deep gulf you have implunged them? Oh what joy can you have in them, in their beauty, comelineſs, towardlineſs, or their ſweet natural parts, whiles this ſad thought is ever and anon coming into your mindes?

                  <p n="8">8. This truth being duly taken down (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we diſmiſs it) may ſerve to bring us all out of love with one wicked practice which is too common every where, and that's cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and to diſcover it to be a thing both deſperately ſinfull, and even in it ſelf unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.

As for imprecations againſt others, how ordinary are they? there be deboiſt unnatural chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which bluſh not to curſe their parents; ſo parents curſe their children, maſters their ſervants, and one neighbour another; you ſhall hear a man ſometimes curſe his horſe, if he do but ſtumble; or his cattel, if they turn out of the way; or his very axe, ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or the working-tool in his hand, if it miſcarry. In ſhort, there is no language ſo ready to our common people, if they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed or put into paſſion, as hangment, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, the devil, a miſchief, the pox, or the like; when as the mad man, they caſt fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, arrows and death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.18. And ſome have ſo accuſtomed their tongues to ſuch helliſh ſpeeches, that they are to them but words of courſe, they curſe when they mean no harm; which is an abominable ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gods Name in vain; ſeeing every imprecation is (virtually at leaſt) a prayer to God to do the thing expreſſed or intended therein. Let me adviſe you therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121171:54"/> what you are doing; you are under the curſe of the Law, and will you be ſo bold and buſie with it? Oh that you were wiſe, and that ye would cauſe theſe words to ſinke down into your ears, and ſeriouſly ponder in your hearts theſe particulars following:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Curſing is given in Scripture, as the mark and brand of perſons that are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly profane, and ſuch as are ſtrangers from God, and in the bond of iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.7. his mouth is full of curſing.

                  <p n="2">2. It is very unbeſeeming, and inconſiſtent with the profeſſion of Religion, not becoming thoſe which have given their names to Chriſt; and from that very conſideration ſometimes forbidden, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.31. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. it is ſo foul a thing, that the practice of it (if habituated and frequent) will ſcarcely ſtand with ſaving grace; Chriſtians that give way to it, and ſuffer themſelves to be overcome by it, do very much forget themſelves. See <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.4, 10. &amp;c. <hi>Peter</hi> foully overtaken, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.74.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It argues a great meaſure of flintineſs, and ſtrange audaciouſneſs of ſpirit, when a man dare adventure to play with ſuch edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tools, to bandie ſo terrible a thing as the curſe is, and to dally with it upon every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling occaſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:121171:54"/>4. In thus doing, you take upon you the office of the Law; yea you ſtep into the Lords own ſeat. God hath put this burthen on the Law (as to bleſs the obſervers, ſo) to curſe the tranſgreſſors of it; how dareſt thou then incroach upon it? who made thee a Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; or who gave thee this authority? Oh take heed, thou makeſt thy ſelf guilty of moſt unwarrantable uſurpation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You invite the curſe, and call for it to come and ſeize upon your ſelves, or others, as if it were too ſlow, and made not haſte e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but thou maiſt be well aſſured it hath wings; its the flying roll; and thou wilt find to thy ſorrow one day, that it comes with too much ſpeed, thou needeſt not to haſten it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. You adde more miſery to the miſerable. Thou art wretched above meaſure already, through the curſe of the Law which lieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee; wilt thou increaſe thy wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by ſealing up the curſe againſt thy ſelf, and that with thine own mouth? Thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are in a wofull condition, by means of the ſin and curſe which thou haſt derived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and wilt thou make it more wofull by pronouncing a curſe upon them with thine own lips? may not many a child ſay to his father and mother, Is it not enough that you have brought me into the world accurſed by the Law of God, but I muſt have your curſe alſo?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Yea laſtly, you provoke the Lord to take you at your words, and to ſay, Well, be it unto you, even as you will. Thou ſaiſt, God
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:121171:55"/> damn me; its a bargain thou ſhalt be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The Lord doth oftentimes ſend down the curſe upon the children, according to the imprecation of their parents, the prints whereof ſtick upon them viſibly all their days. They that love curſing, ſhall have curſing enough, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.17, 18, 19.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> The ſecond Concluſion; what this imports, that Chriſt was made a curſe for us.</head>
                  <p>THe ſecond Concluſion or Doctrine which theſe words hold forth unto us, is this: Chriſt was made a curſe for us which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe of the Law; Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, the ſecond perſon in Trinity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a curſe for the ſons of men, who ſtand accurſed by the doome of Gods righteous Law.</p>
                  <p>Let it be obſerved, that he is not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, but a curſe; and this expreſſion is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both for more ſignificancy and fulneſs, to note out the truth and realneſs of the thing, and alſo to ſhew the order and way he took for bringing us back unto that bleſſedneſs which we had loſt. The Law was our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in our innocent condition, and ſo it was our bleſſedneſs, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.25. but the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> falling away from God by his firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion implunged himſelf into all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:121171:55"/> and ſo inwrapped himſelf in the curſe: Now Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that he may reſtore loſt man into an eſtate of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he becomes that for them, which the Law is unto them, namely a curſe;<note place="margin">Rom. 10 4.</note> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning where the Law ends, and ſo going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſatisfie the demands of the Law to the uttermoſt; he becomes firſt a curſe for them, and then their righteouſneſs, and ſo their bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p>For making good this truth, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to clear theſe two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What this is, that he is made a curſe for us; and wherein it ſtands?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By whom, or by what power he was made a curſe for us?</p>
                  <p>For the former:</p>
                  <p>Chriſts becoming a curſe for us, ſtands in this; that whereas we are all accurſed by the ſentence of the Law, becauſe of ſin, he now comes into our room, and ſtands under the ſtroak of that curſe which of right belongs to us; ſo that it lies not now any longer on the backs of poor ſinners, but on him, for them, and in their ſtead; therefore he is called a ſurety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. the ſurety ſtands in the room of a debtor, malefactor, or him that is any way obnoxious to the Law; ſuch is <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity: we are by the doom of the Law, evil doers, tranſgreſſors; and upon that ſcore we ſtand indebted to the juſtice of God, and lie vnder the ſtroke of his wrath. Now the Lord Jeſus ſeeing us in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſteps in, and ſtands between us and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:121171:56"/> the blow; yea, he takes this wrath and curſe off from us unto himſelf; he ſtands not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or meerly, after the manner of a ſurety among men, in the caſe of debt: for here the ſurety indeed enters bond with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal for the payment of the debt; but yet he expects that the debtor ſhould not put him to it, but that he ſhould diſcharge the debt himſelf, he onely ſtands as a back-ſet of good ſecurity. No, Chriſt Jeſus doth not expect that we ſhould pay the debt our ſelves, but he takes it wholly to himſelf, as a ſurety for a murtherer or traitor, or ſome other noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious malefactor, that hath broken priſon and is run away; he lies by it body for body, ſtate for ſtate, and undergoes whatſoever the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor is chargeable withall for ſatisfying the Law: even ſo the Lord Jeſus ſtands ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for us, runnagate malefactors, making himſelf liable to all that curſe which belongs to us, that he might both anſwer the Law fully, and bring us back again to God. As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the room of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind fallen:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18.</note> ſo Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſtands in the room of all mankind which is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; he ſuſtains the perſon of all thoſe which do ſpiritually deſcend from him, and unto whom he beares the relation of an head.</p>
                  <p>But to open it yet more fully, I conceive that to this making of him a curſe for us, theſe three things do concur:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His taking upon him the nature of man, which is both ſinfull and accurſed; the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:121171:56"/> were partakers of fleſh and blood, and he alſo took part of the ſame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. he came in the likeneſs of ſinfull (and therefore of accurſed fleſh) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. he took upon him the nature, not of this or that particular man, as <hi>Abraham, David, Peter,</hi> or any other, but the nature of mankind in general; even that ſelf-ſame nature that ſinned, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accurſed. It was not a ſimilitude or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of fleſh, or a meer ſhew of being a man, but truly, really, ſenſibly fleſh or manhood, as himſelf avouched to his Diſciples after his reſurrection, bidding them handle him, that they might be ſatisfied that it was not a ſpirit which they ſaw, but the very ſame true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which he had before, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39. The Word or ſecond Perſon in Trinity, took the nature of man into the unity of his perſon, that it might dwell and have its ſubſiſtence in the Godhead onely, <hi>John</hi> 1.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The real imputation of our ſin (or the guilt of our ſin) to him.<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.6.</note> He was made ſin for us, even he which knew no ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. All the ſins of the Elect were charged upon him, both original and actual, and he had them all by imputation, without any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſin in him at all; he had no ſin of his own, neither of nature nor practice, for he was conceived by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo was born holy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. And beſides, had the guilt but of one, even the ſmalleſt perſonal ſin been upon his ſoul, it would have utterly diſabled him from the work of his Mediatorſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. yet he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:121171:57"/> had the ſins of others; the ſin of the world was laid at his door, as if it had been his own; he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors,<note place="margin">Mar. 15.28.</note> 
                     <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.37. And thus the Lord looked upon him as a ſinner upon our account. If this had not been ſo, how could either death have been juſtly inflicted upon him, or his merit have been imputed unto us? This muſt be <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> meaning, when he ſaith Chriſt was the greateſt ſinner; he was <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> that Idolater, <hi>David</hi> that adulterer, <hi>Peter</hi> that denier of his Maſter, &amp;c. to wit, by imputation onely, he being made ſin for them, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>

As he became a debtor, and was ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, even ſo he made payment thereof; he was made a ſacrifice for ſin, and bare to the full all that ever divine juſtice did or could require, even the uttermoſt extent of the curſe of the Law of God. He muſt thus undergo the curſe, becauſe he had taken upon him our ſin: The juſtice of the moſt high God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Law looks upon the Lord Jeſus as a ſinner, becauſe he hath undertaken for us, and ſeizeth upon him accordingly, pouring down on his head that curſe and thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are threatened in it againſt ſin; for the curſe followeth ſin, as the ſhadow the body, whether it be ſin inherent, or ſin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: even as the bleſſing follows righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whether it be righteouſneſs inherent, or righteouſneſs imputed. The Scripture is very
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:121171:57"/> clear and full in holding forth this, as the main part of the curſe; it was propheſied of long before, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5. &amp;c. he was ſtricken or ſmitten, and this ſtriking was even unto wounding, and this wounding was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with bruiſing. And becauſe all our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities (in the puniſhments of them) met in him, as all rivers in one ſea, all arrows in one butt, all the Regiments of an Army in one place of rendezvous, therefore he was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; for he was brought forth as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, in his humiliation his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was taken away, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.33. yea, he was cut off from the Land of the living: It was alſo fore-typified and repreſented by many ſorts of Sacrifices in the Law.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5 7.</note> All thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and types were accompliſhed in him; he told his diſciples often in the days of his fleſh, that he muſt ſuffer many things; and ſo he did; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. &amp; 28. He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared once in the end of the world, to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf; and, He was once offered, to bear the ſins of many. All this ſuffering is comprehended in that ſentence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. In the day that thou ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, thou ſhalt die; this was the puniſhment which Divine Juſtice did award againſt ſin; therefore this he muſt ſuffer.</p>

There was a preparation to it by many ſmaller and lighter skirmiſhes; for (having emptied himſelf of his glory, ſo that he did not appear to be that which indeed he was, and ſubjected himſelf to the ſtate of a ſervant, and ſo a meet object of ſuffering) he became a man of ſorrows all his life long, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3. compaſſed about with infirmity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. as ſoon as he was born he was laid in a manger, becauſe there was no room for him in the Inne; while he was very young he was perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and forced to flie into Aegypt<note place="margin">

Is not this the carpenter, &amp;c? He was the object of mans reproach, he was called a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and ſinners, an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> one that hath a devil; he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the infirmities which are incident to mankind, as hunger, thirſt, poverty; he was betrayed by <hi>Judas,</hi> forſaken by his diſciples, abuſed by the Jews, mocked, buffetted, ſpit upon, crowned with thorns, accuſed, arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, condemned as the vileſt malefactor. In one word, he was a worm, and no man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The main brunt it ſelf was, that he was ſtruck with death. The Sacrifice in the Law was to be ſlain; the goat which was to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for a ſin-offering for the people, muſt be killed, and the blood of it muſt be brought within the veil, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.15. The ſame courſes (as to killing) was to be taken with the burnt-offering,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:121171:58"/> peace-offering, and treſpaſs-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as we may ſee in the 1, 3, 5, 6, 7. chapters of <hi>Leviticus.</hi> So it was propheſied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. he poured out his ſoul unto the death; and elſewhere often.</p>
                  <p>Now this death which Chriſt did undergo, was both of the body and ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſuffered the death of the body, called the firſt death; this <hi>Gabriel</hi> the Angel revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſome 1006 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. the Meſſiah ſhall be cut off; the accompliſhment whereof the ſtories of the Evangeliſts relate very largely, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.33. his life is taken from the earth. We by ſin had deſerved the firſt death, the taking down of this earthly frame, by the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul and body, therefore Chriſt our ſurety muſt die that death for us; the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular end of death which he ſhould and did ſuffer, was the death of the croſs; which was ſo deſigned and ordered by the all-wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and providence of God, both becauſe it was very painfull and grievous, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a moſt ſhamefull and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death; but eſpecially becauſe it was, even by divine appointment, ſtigmatized with this brand of infamy, that whoſoever was hanged on a tree, was to be accounted ceremonially accurſed, as it is avouched in the cloſe of the verſe. It was not neceſſary that he ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all the ſeveral ſorts of death, as ſtoning, burning, ſawing, beheading, &amp;c. it was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that he ſuffered that one kind of death, which the wiſdom of God ſaw to be moſt fit
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:121171:59"/> and ſuitable; neither yet was it neceſſary, that his death ſhould be attended with ſuch cruelties, as ſome men have been enforced to ſuffer, as pulling the fleſh from the bone, pinching it with hot pincers, and the like: Theſe are rather perſonal, than natural, and meerly accidental, not eſſential to the firſt death: Therefore the legs of Chriſt were not broken; and although his body was laid in the grave, yet he ſaw no corruption, becauſe theſe infirmities did not conſiſt with the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his perſon; and the latter would have made void the fruit and effect of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Therefore the Scripture declares both theſe to be contrary to Gods will. See <hi>Jo.</hi> 19.33-36. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.31.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſuffered the death of the ſoul, or that which is called the ſecond death. Sin brought death into the world; not onely that death which pulls down this earthly frame, but alſo that which makes a wofull ſeparation of the whole man from God: Therefore the Lord Jeſus muſt undergo this death too, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. he made his ſoul an offering for ſin.

Neither was it a total or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual withdrawing, but onely in part, and for a time; the Lord turned away his face from him for a little ſeaſon, he hid himſelf out of his ſight, and would not be found; he took off the ſweet influence of the joy and comfort of the ſpirit, ſuſpending them for a time, and keeping off from him at a great diſtance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. yet all this while God was preſent with him by his ſupporting grace, ſo that he had ſome intermiſſions, and an Angel came to comfort him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43.<note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. On the croſs; here was the main blow; he bare our ſins on the tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. here the wrath of Almighty God lay on his ſoul, in the whole weight of it. Now the juſtice of God muſters all his forces, and gathers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all his regiments, to fall upon Chriſt with his whole army, as if he would rout him
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:121171:60"/> at once. He deſcended into hell, I mean not locally, into the place of the damned; for after death his body went down to the grave, and was locally there for the ſpace of three days; and his ſoul went into paradice; that is, into heaven, the place of bliſs and glory; as <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. but onely virtually and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, in that being Mediator, and ſtanding in our ſtead, he did, even while he was on the croſs, before he gave up the ghoſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo thoſe helliſh pains and ſorrows in his ſoul, which were due to us for ſin. The Lord took him and plunged him into the ſea of his wrath; all the waves and billows of it came rouling over his head, and he ſunk down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very depths of death. The Prophet <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> being in the belly of the whale, was a type of Chriſt, both in his corporal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual death; therefore thoſe things may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be applied to his ſoul-ſufferings, which he complains of, <hi>John</hi> 2.3, 4, &amp;c. the extremity whereof forced him to cry out with a loud voice, Why haſt thou forſaken me? <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46, even as <hi>Jonah</hi> had ſaid long before, I am caſt out of thy ſight, <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.4. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this; Chriſt on the croſs hath the fury of the battel poured down upon him, ſo that he bare the very heat and burden of it; here he drank up the very dregs and bitterneſs of the cup, even to the bottom.</p>

                  <p>FRom all theſe particulars we may obſerve (onely as by the way) theſe three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the ſufferings of Chriſt were not ſeeming, and in ſhew onely, but real, and indeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the bodily ſufferings and death of Chriſt, were not ſufficient to ſatisfie for the ſins of the world, but he muſt alſo undergo the ſufferings and death of the ſoul. For the proper ſeat and ſubject of ſin is the ſoul, not the body (which is but as the ſouls ſhop, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it as the Smith doth his hammer and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile) therefore if he had not ſuffered in ſoul, the plaiſter had been narrower than the ſore.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the ſufferings of the ſoul were not barely mediate, or by conſent from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as ſympathizing onely with it, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and immediate. The ſoul is the firſt and principal in ſin, the body but the inſtrument. It is moſt agreeable to juſtice, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſhould be rather deeper in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the inſtrument; which holds not here, if the body ſuffer immediately, and the ſoul onely by ſympathy. Doubtleſs, that ſame wrath of God, thoſe terrors and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:121171:61"/> of hell (for the ſubſtance of them) fell down-right upon the ſoul of Chriſt, which ſinners ſhould, and reprobates muſt endure in their ſouls for ſin.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſtill this muſt be underſtood <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in ſuch a way as ſuits with the dignity of the perſon ſuffering; there was a mitigation or abatement in his ſoul-ſufferings from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour which the damned ſhall be put to, in three particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the place of ſuffering; this is but a circumſtance in the buſineſs; hell [the place of the damned] is no part of the debt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither is ſuffering there locally any part of the payment of it: no more than a priſon is any part of an earthly debt, or of the payment of it. The ſurety may ſatisfie the creditor in the place appointed for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in the open court; which being done, the debtor and ſurety both are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, that they need not go to priſon; if either of them goe to priſon, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not, or cannot pay the debt: for all that juſtice requires, is to ſatisfie the debt, to the which the priſon is meerly extrinſecal: even ſo the juſtice of God cannot be ſatisfied for the tranſgreſſion of his Law, but by the death of the ſinner; but it doth not require that this ſhould be done in the place of the damned. The wicked goe to priſon, becauſe they do not, they cannot make ſatisfaction otherwiſe; Chriſt having fully diſcharged the debt, needed not to go to priſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:121171:62"/>2. In the time of continuance; the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned muſt bear the wrath of God to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe they can never ſatisfie the juſtice of God for ſin, therefore they muſt lie by it world without end; but Chriſt hath made an infinite ſatisfaction in a finite time, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing that fierce battel with the wrath of God, and getting the victory in a few hours, which is equivalent to the creatures bearing it, and grapling with it everlaſtingly. The lenth or ſhortneſs of durance, is but a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not of any neceſſary conſideration in this caſe. Suppoſe a man indebted 100 l. and likely to lie in priſon till he ſhall pay it, yet utterly unable; if another man comes and lays down the money on two hours warning, is not this as well, or better done? That which may be done to as good or better purpoſe, in a ſhort time, what need is there to draw it out at length? The juſtice of the Law did not require, that either the ſinner or his ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould ſuffer the eternity of hells torments,<note place="margin">Non aeterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, ſed duntaxat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitatem.</note> but onely their extremity. It doth abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counterpoiſe the eternity of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the perſon which ſuffered was the eternal God. Beſides, it was impoſſible that he ſhould be detained under the ſorrows of death, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24. and if he had been ſo detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then he had not ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, nor triumphed over them, but had been overcome, and ſo had not attained his end.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In a companion of the pains of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, unavoidably attending it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:121171:62"/> to wit, deſperation; an utter hopeleſneſſe of any good; a certain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and waiting on the worſt that can befall. I ſhall not enter into a diſpute, whether the deſpair of the damned in hell, be properly a ſin ot not; there be good Divines, both ancient and modern, that hold the negative; which to me ſeemes moſt probable, not ſo much from that ground on which they go, that there is no ſin in hell (it being the place of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, not of doing) nor from this, that deſpair being the privation of hope, as hope is not of the things which are ſeene,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.24.</note> ſo deſpair is not of the things which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready felt. Whence ſome would infer, that as hope in the glorified Saints ceaſeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have now the enjoyment of the bleſſedneſs which they expected: ſo deſpair ſhall ceaſe in the damned, becauſe they are poſſeſſed already of everlaſting deſtruction. But I ſuppoſe it cannot rationally be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that the damned in hell do deſpair; onely I ſay, it is very probable that this deſpair is not properly a ſin; for as hope doth ever ſuppoſe and eye a promiſe of ſome good thing to come, apprehending it as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and waiting for the accompliſhment: ſo deſperation (hopes contrary) muſt needs be exerciſed about the ſame object, but puts forth a contrary act, apprehends the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as impoſſible, and caſts off all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the accompliſhment of it. Now promiſes are confined to this life onely,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:121171:63"/> although the things promiſed (for the beſt part of them) are to be enjoyed in the life to come; there are no promiſes made to them that are actually damned in hell, of any future good; and therefore as it would be no vertue in them to hope, ſo it is no ſin in them to deſpaire. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne; the wretched ſinner in hell ſeeing the ſentence paſſed againſt him, Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe fulfilled, never to be reverſed, the gates of hell made faſt upon him,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.26.</note> and a great gulfe fixed betwixt hell and heaven, which renders his eſcape impoſſible, he now gives up all, and reckons on nothing but the uttermoſt miſery. Now this deſpair is not an eſſential part of the ſecond death, but onely a conſequent, or (at the moſt) an effect, occaſioned by the ſinners view of his irremedileſſe wofull condition. But this neither did, nor could poſſibly befall the Lord Jeſus; he was able by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his God-head, both to ſuffer, and to ſatisfie, and to overcome, therefore he expected a good iſſue, and knew that the end ſhould be happy, and that he ſhould not be aſhamed,<note place="margin">Pſ 16.9.10.

Neither was man able to put him into this condition, to make him a Curſe, no, nor all the men in the world. It was not the iniquity of the times, into which he was fallen; although it was a very evill time (their very hour, and the power of darkneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.53.) yet that was not the proper working cauſe of it. Neither was it the perfidiouſneſs of <hi>Judas</hi> his houſhold ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; that was but a remote interveening means for the bringing, of it on, or raiſing it up to the height. Nor was it the miſchievous diſpoſition, and plottings of the high Prieſts, and Jews againſt him; he could eaſily have befooled, and prevented them all; he could for a word of his mouth have had a guard of more than twelve legions of Angels for his aſſiſtance, or reſcue, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.53, 54. And when they came to apprehend him, he did but ſpeak a word, and they went backward, and fell to the ground, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.6.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:121171:65"/> pleaſure of an higher, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.10, 11. So then it was not any one of theſe, nor all theſe put together, that could poſſibly bring the Son of God under the Curſe; they were onely ſubordinate inſtruments, acting in ſome parts of it; but he was infinitely above them all.

                  <p n="2">2 Poſitively. The Scripture holds forth three things, very remarkable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which (being taken joyntly) are that ſoveraign power, whereby Chriſt was made a Curſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The decree and appointment of God.

The hands whereby he was taken, crucified, and ſlain, were wicked hands, yet thoſe hands therein did that very thing, which the hand and counſel of God determined before to be done, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.28. Therefore he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. that is, 1.

It is obſervable, that the Scripture aſcribes the diſpenſation of this whole work to God
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:121171:65"/> the Father, as the firſt moover, and ſovereign Manager of it; He laid on him our iniquity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. He made him to be ſin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.

                  <p>And this Covenant of God with Chriſt, is the very baſis or bottome of the Covenant of Grace. God made a Covenant with Chriſt, the ſpiritual <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 89.3, 4. that he might make a Covenant with all his Elect in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26, 27. He made this Agreement with Chriſt as the Head, and on this is reared up the whole frame of precious promiſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the Covenant of Grace, as a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly building upon a ſure foundation. And herein the Levitical Prieſthood was a type of the Prieſthood of Chriſt. That was ſettled on <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his ſucceſſors, and continued unto them by Covenant, their anointing was to be an everlaſting Prieſthood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.15. and more fully, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.12, 13. he gave to <hi>Phineas,</hi> and to his ſeed, the Covenant of an everlaſting Prieſthood; and by vertue thereof, they were inabled to manage the Covenant of life and peace, which was with them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.5. as to the Legal and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial adminiſtration of it; even ſo the true Prieſthood is ſettled on Chriſt, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by Covenant, and by vertue of this he manageth the Covenant of Grace in its Evangelical and Spiritual adminiſtration. And as they muſt bear the iniquity of the Congregation, and ſo be made [typically] a Curſe for them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.17. So Chriſt muſt be made a Curſe [truly by imputation] by bearing the iniquity of the Congregation of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:121171:68"/> the firſt-born, which are written in heaven. Only the Apoſtle gives us this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two Covenants, that thoſe in the Law were made Prieſts without an oath, but Chriſt was made with an oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.20, 21. For the proof of which, he brings <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. noting out a ſpecial preheminence of his Prieſthood above theirs, that theirs was changeable, and ſo had an end; but his is unchangeable and perpetual; the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving confirmed the Covenant by his Oath, and ſo infeoffed him in it by a grant never to be revoked. Therefore Covenant and Oath are ſometimes put together, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.3.</p>
                  <p>But I am ſenſible, that I have expatiated too far. The iſſue of all is this in ſhort; Chriſt being made a Curſe for us, proceeds from the purpoſe, and good pleaſure of God appointing him, and calling him out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and it is the execution of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and glorious deſign, or contrivement agreed upon by God and Chriſt, for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſalvation of the Elect.

Oh that the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> would look about them, &amp; begin at length ſeriouſly to conſider, what an hideous Monſter they nouriſh, what a venemous Serpent they keep, yea hug in their boſomes. Look upon it in this glaſs, and ſee how black, and ugly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. If you have not ſeen it by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Law, ſo as to humble you, and to lay you low before the Lord, I beſeech you, turn your eyes unto Jeſus Chriſt, and ſee what foul work it hath made, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief it hath brought on him. Behold here a ſtrange ſight, a ſad ſpectacle, the bleſſed Son of God made acurſed. The juſtice of the Law hath found him amongſt ſinners, and ſingled him out from all the company, and ſet him as a mark to ſhoot at, yea, hath ſpent all the arrows of its quiver upon him, and thereby hath mangled, and rent, and torn, and wounded him grievouſly, yea hath brought him down to the gates of death, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as low as hell. When thou haſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to thy minde in this pittiful pickle, then reflect upon thy ſelf, and ſay, What evill beaſt hath done this? Was it any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that he hath done againſt the Law in his own perſon, that hath provoked it to pour out ſuch a flood of curſes upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:121171:69"/> Oh no, he was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, there was no ſpot of unrighteouſneſs in him. It was for my rebellion, treaſon, apoſtacy from my Maker,<note place="margin">Me, me, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum qui feci.</note> I have ſinned, and Chriſt hath ſuffered the curſe for my ſin. Take now a ſurvey of the ſeveral branches of this curſe, and ſee how it dogged him all along from his birth, to his burial, eſpecially the griefes, and the groans, the ſorrows, and the ſweats, the tears, the terrors, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his ſoul under the power of the ſecond death, and then ſay in thy heart, Oh fool that I was, I did not beleeve, that ſin had been ſo exceeding bad as it is, I ſee now it is no tame beaſt, but an unreaſonable ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous devouring Serpent, full of deadly poyſon. Canſt thou ſee all this heavy load lying on the back of Chriſt, and yet judge any ſin to be ſmall, or go on with a proud heart, and a high look, maintaining thine old league with ſin, and continuing in the hell of thine accurſed natural condition, as if it were thy heaven?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It re-mindes us further of the greatneſs of that miſery, whereinto man is implunged by ſin: For if Chriſt be made a curſe, who had no ſin of his own, but onely ours laid upon him; What a grievous curſe then, muſt needs lye upon them, who have the guilt of their perſonal ſins ſticking cloſe to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and ſtill lye weltring in their own gore-blood? eſpecially on thoſe wretched ſouls which muſt bear the wrath due to ſin in their own perſons for ever? The men of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:121171:69"/> world put the evil day far from them, they feel no harme, they fear no danger, and therefore they bleſſe themſelves in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, and ſay, No curſe ſhall take hold upon them: But oh how much better were it to reaſon thus? Chriſt was made a curſe for ſinners, therefore ſurely ſinners in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and without Chriſt are in a deſperate condition. If we ſhould ſee a man grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tormented, and put to death with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary tortures, and ſhould withall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he ſuffered all theſe things for another mans crimes, and not for his own, we would conclude thus, Surely, that man was a notorious Malefactor; and if the ſtroke of Juſtice had fallen upon his own head, what a terrible death muſt he have indured? If this curſe was ſo bitter, his wrath ſo heavy on Chriſt our Surety, how unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably bitter, and heavy would it be on us the principals? Yea bring it home to thy ſelf, and ſay, Alas, What have I done? I have ſurely ſpun a fair thred, I have brought my ſelf into a lamentable condition, that either the Son of God muſt come down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and be made a curſe for me, or elſe I muſt lye by it for ever.

                  <p n="3">3 It preſents unto us the exactneſs and impartialneſs of the juſtice of God againſt ſinners, in that he will let the curſe fall even on the head of his onely begotten Son, if he finde ſin upon him. Tribulation, and

If any might have eſcaped, who more likely than the Son of his boſome, the Son of his delights? but he might not be ſpared. Juſtice will not ſuffer it, but puts in its plea, and ſaith, I expect reparation for the tranſgreſſion of my righteous Law; If therefore Jeſus Chriſt hath undertaken to pay this debt for ſinners, let him look to it, I muſt, and will be ſatisfied to the uttermoſt farthing. He is willing to be their Surety, and to ſtand in their room; let him therefore bear the whole burden, I will not acquit him, till he hath diſcharged the whole debt. No, no, his loud crying, and tears, his bloody and painful ſweats, his fervent, and heaven-piercing prayers, his often renewed petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that this cup might paſs away from him, not any one of theſe, nor all theſe could prevail, to ſtay the hand of Divine juſtice, but he muſt take off this cup of the Curſe, and drink it even to the bottome. Oh that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:121171:70"/> our ſecure ſinners in Sion, would weigh theſe things ſadly, and take the meaſure of the Lords ſeverity againſt ſin, by his dealing with his own Son, and think thus, If theſe things be done in the green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry? <hi>Luke</hi> 23.31. If he was ſo ſtrict with his Son, what will he be to his ſlave? If he dealt ſo ſharply with his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, how will he deal with his enemy? If his righteous ſervant eſcape thus hardly, where ſhall the ungodly, and ſinner appear? <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.31.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It commends unto us the unſpeakable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the love of the Lord Jeſus to poor undone ſinners.

An oath thus taken, is an act of religion, and ſo a kind of bleſſing of God: but if it ſwerve from theſe rules, it is a fearfull ſin, ſtraitly forbidden by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.34. &amp;c. and by the Apoſtle <hi>James, chap.</hi> 5.12. and is no better than a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God; eſpecially that helliſh kind of ſwearing, which is attended with ſuch outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious blaſphemies againſt the Lord Jeſus. If becauſe of ſwearing,<note place="margin">Ier. 23.10.</note> the Land mourneth; then much more for thoſe deſperate and bloody oaths, which reach to the curſing of Chriſt our Saviour. The word there uſed, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth both ſwearing and curſing; which ſhews the near affinity betwixt theſe two, and implies to us, that every irregular taking up of the Name of God, or Chriſt in an oath, is in effect a curſing of them. Alas my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the heavie curſe of the Law of God, which is due to us all for ſin, and might have cruſhed us for ever, is fallen upon him, and hath torn and mangled him pitifully; and ſhall wretched creatures be ſo barbarous, as to toſs his holy Name up and down in their unhallowed mouths, and to tear and mangle
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:121171:77"/> him anew, by their horrible and villanous oaths? Is not this to lay more curſes upon him, and even to oppreſs him with curſes?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe, who making a general profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and expecting ſalvation by him, do yet walk on in their ſins, and take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the abounding of grace in the Goſpel, to be more licentious, and to adde ſin to ſin, as drunkenneſs to thirſt, making the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and profeſſion of Religion an embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener to looſeneſs, to the abuſe of lawfull liberties, and to unwarrantable practiſes. The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> gives us the character of theſe, calling them ungodly men, which turn the grace of God into laſciviouſneſs, and deny the onely Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us an hint of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. the abounding grace of God manifeſted in Chriſt, is both the Motive and End of their continuing in ſin; they ſin both becauſe grace doth abound, and that it may abound. But oh! little do theſe perſons conſider, that this grace could not have been feaſable, but by Chriſts bearing the curſe for our ſins. And if it coſt ſo dear a price, ſhall we cauſe him to pay it again? ſhall we be ſo bold, as ſin ſtill, and thereby put him to bear the curſe over and over again, as often as we ſin? far be it from us to do ſo wickedly. The looſe and careleſſe Chriſtian, which makes account that Chriſt became a curſe for him, and yet followeth his old trade ſtill, doth (as it were) give Chriſt this malapert language; Lord Chriſt, I know thou art
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:121171:78"/> richly able to bear the curſe, were it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times heavier than it is: therefore I will put thee to it, I will ſin ſtill, and thou muſt bear the curſe ſtill, I will not reſtrain my ſelf from any of thoſe courſes which ſome men call ſinfull, but I will walk in the waies of mine own heart, and fill my ſelfe with the delights of the fleſh. Its pity thou ſhouldſt not have load enough, that art ſo good at bearing the curſe. Oh abominable ranting! that terrible denunciation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20. &amp;c. may be applied to this caſe, by an argument from the leſs to the greater, thus: He that heareth that Chriſt is made a curſe for him, and yet bleſſeth himſelf in his heart, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth himſelf in ſin, the Lord will not ſpare him, but all the curſes of Gods book ſhall lie upon him, &amp;c. Yea laſtly, every miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in the profeſſion of Religion, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly allowed, or continued in, through negligence or remiſſeneſs, is in ſome degree a curſing of God; which I gather from that ſpeech of <hi>Job</hi> concerning his ſons, <hi>Job</hi> 1.5. It ſeems the ſin which he ſuſpected they were guilty of, was the neglect of their watch, that they willingly ſuffered looſeneſs and vanity to ſeize upon their ſpirits,<note place="margin">See the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Annot. &amp; Caryl. <hi>in loc.</hi>
                     </note> which might bring forth ſome unſavoury fruits without. A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady to which even good men are ſubject, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in times of feaſting. And this he calls curſing God in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Unto theſe, and all the reſt of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in evil, I muſt ſpeak a word or two, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a lamentation, and pleading againſt
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:121171:78"/> them on the behalf of Chriſt. Oh ye ſons of men, what abominable thing is this that ye do? why do ye offer ſuch hard meaſures to him who hath put himſelf upon ſuch perilous adventures, yea extremities, that he might ſave you from utter deſtruction? Give ear, and hear the Lord Jeſus pleading his own cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you thus, what iniquity have you found in me, that you deal thus baſely with me, that you handle me ſo cruelly? you can find none in me but that which lay firſt at your own doors, and is charged vpon me on your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; or as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the day of her ſore affliction bemoaning her condition, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12.<note place="margin">

                  <p>THe third Concluſion or Doctrine, is the marrow and ſumme of the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt, by being made a Curſe for us, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the curſe of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the reſult, the iſſue, the fruit of the Lord Chriſts becoming a curſe for us, that hereby we are redeemed from the curſe of the Law, under which we were held. This Truth may receive proof from the conſent of other Scriptures. Let us hear but two or three of the fulleſt teſtimonies, that thereby it may be eſtabliſhed, <hi>Gal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 4, 5. God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to redeem us, &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11, 12. Chriſt, by a greater, and more perfect Tabernacle than that under the Law, and by his own blood — hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal Redemption for us. Obſerve here, that this Redemption followeth upon, and floweth from Chriſts becoming a Curſe for us, two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In the intention, and purpoſe of God and Chriſt. God the Father in his eternal counſel, did propound unto himſelf this end of giving Chriſt, and Chriſt in the fulneſs of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:121171:79"/> time, did ſet before his eyes the ſame, and in giving himſelf to become a curſe, that poor inthralled ſinners might be redeemed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from the curſe of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In the effect, and event of the thing. Look what the Lord did intend to work, and to bring about by Chriſts undergoing the curſe for us, the ſame was, and is throughly wrought, and brought about to the full. The thing is done, as to the making of a plenary ſatisfaction to Divine juſtice, and ſo obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benefit of Redemption, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all thoſe, for whom the Lord hath appointed it in his eternal purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But for a more particular clearing, and beating out of this Doctrine, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To ſhew what this Redemption is, and wherein it ſtands.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To give ſome arguments or grounds of Scripture-reaſon, for the confirmation of it.</p>
                  <p>For the former, the Scriptures of the New Teſtament afford us ſeveral words to expreſs the nature of this benefit. The moſt general word is rendred <hi>[Deliverance]</hi> and notes out a ſetting one free by any means whatſoever, as in the Lords Prayer <hi>[Deliver us from evil]</hi> Mat. 6.13. &amp; 2 Pet. 2.9. <hi>[T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The former is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Captives or Priſoners, who being in bondage to others, are ſet at liberty by the payment of a Ranſome.

                  <p n="2">2 As it is a benefit actually brought home, &amp; applied to elect ſinners by effectual calling, Jeſus Chriſt was made a curſe, and ſo became a ſacrifice for ſinners, not that they might immediately without any more ado, be made partakers of the redemption purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereby, or be actually redeemed upon the very offering made, but that, having
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:121171:81"/> firſt made this benefit feaſible, ſo that now there is ſuch a thing to be had, which without him (neither is, nor could be) he might afterwards communicate it to the Elect, and give them the perſonal poſſeſſion of it, that they might enjoy it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And this he doth by a powerful draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to himſelf, and ſo by union to him, they have a real intereſt in this benefit. Therefore the Apoſtle ſometimes ſpeaks of it as appropriated to beleevers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. and Jehovah ſtiles himſelf the Churches Redeemer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.26. as often elſewhere, and <hi>Job</hi> calls him his Redeemer, <hi>Job.</hi> 19.25.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe conſiderations are here implied, as depending neceſſarily the one upon the other, in reſpect of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved; and that they are not to be confounded, but diſtinguiſhed, appears by <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. where we may obſerve a clear difference betwixt the death of the Mediator for the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of tranſgreſſions, and receiving the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the inheritance. This latter being laid down as a conſequent, or fruit of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and limited to them, that are called.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Take the whole in this ſhort ſumme, Redemption is the buying out, and delivering of ſinners from the curſe of the Law, and ſo from the guilt of ſin, and the wrath of God, and the condemation of hell due thereunto by the death and ſatifaction of Chriſt the Mediator.</p>

We had ſold our ſelves to a ſtranger, even to Satan, to ſerve him; Chriſt is a near kinſman, one of the ſame ſtock and blood with us, therefore the right of redemption is his. It was alſo a ſtatute, and a cuſtome in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> That if a man dyed, having no childe to inherit after him, then his brother, or next kinſman ſhould take his wife, and raiſe up ſeed to his deceaſed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.5. &amp;c. and withall, if the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance were alienated, or ſet to ſale, he was to buy it out, or redeem it, for the uſe of the firſt-born, that ſo it might continue ſettled upon the Family of the dead man. Wee have a clear inſtantial Goſpel-truth lys hid (as I conceive) Old <hi>Adam</hi> dyed, and left no ſeed behinde him, that might inherit heaven, and moreover the inheritance was quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and loſt, as to him, and all his; and therefore the Lord thruſt him out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.24. Onely Jeſus Chriſt is found
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:121171:83"/> the next kinſman, who begetting ſons and daughters by the word of Truth, doth therby raiſe up a ſeed of God, &amp; redeem the forfeited inheritance, and ſo ſettle it upon the firſt-born of <hi>Adams</hi> family for ever; yet with this difference, that this ſeed ſhall not be called after the name, nor inherit in the right of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but they ſhall be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord ſhall name, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.2.

And what is the fruit of this glorious deſigne? Why, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſin in the fleſh, that is, by laying the curſe, which the Law threatned againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, upon that very fleſh, or nature, which had ſinned, he hath caſt ſin in its own plea. A mans work may be ſaid to plead for his pay; the crime of a Malefactor cryes for the execution of the Law upon him; ſo ſin pleads againſt the ſinner, and calls for death, its wages to be inflicted upon him. Sin, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as an act it be tranſient, yet in the guilt of it lyes in the Lords high Court of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:121171:83"/> Juſtice, filed upon record againſt the ſinner, and calling aloud for deſerved puniſhment, ſaying, Man hath ſinned, and man muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his ſin. But now Chriſt having ſuffered for ſin, that plea is taken off; Lo here, ſaith the Lord, the ſame nature that ſinned, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, mine own Son being made fleſh, hath ſuffered death for ſin in the fleſh, the thing is done, the Law is ſatisfied; and ſo he non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits the action, and caſts it out of the Court, as unjuſt. Thus whereas ſin would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned us, he hath condemned ſin, and there is now no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 3. The blood of the Mediator out-cryes the clamor of ſin. We read <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.7. &amp;c. of two Goats which were to be preſented before the Lord; the one to be offered for a ſin-offering, the other to be kept alive, for a Scape-goat, that <hi>Aaron</hi> having laid his hands on his head, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed over him all the iniquities of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> might afterwards ſend him away, bearing their iniquities into a Land not inhabited. All this is fulfilled in Chriſt; he hath both given himſelf to be a ſin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, and thereby removed guilt ſo far, that when it is ſought, it cannot be found, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20. So much is implied in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26.

The nature of the things is ſo different, that they cannot concurre in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Although theſe two do uſually ſtand at a diſtance, yet in this great buſineſs of the Redemption of mankinde they cloſe well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. To clear this, take theſe three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Mankinde, by the breach of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become a debtor to juſtice, and under the curſe, even in the extremity of it; and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:121171:85"/> God, who is the party wronged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely ſoveraign Lord, and Lawgiver; Therefore the principal and moſt proper way to effect man's deliverance, was to give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to juſtice, ſo that either ſinners muſt die the death in their own perſons, or Chriſt their ſurety muſt give his life a ranſome for them, being at an utter loſs in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this, it may be objected, Then we muſt ſay, that Chriſt redeemed us from God, and himſelf being God, he redeemed us out of his own hands, by paying a price to himſelf; which is abſurd. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This ſeeming abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity will vaniſh, if we keep to Scripture phraſe, and take along with us theſe Two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The perſon of the Redeemer was not onely God, but alſo man, and although as to the ſufficiency for the work, and the valour, and efficacie of it, he muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be God, yet both the right, and act of Redemption belonged to him properly as man; ſo that we may ſay, It was the man Chriſt, that bought us out of the hands of the curſe, and wrath of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God the Father himſelf had a ſpecial hand in this buſineſs; the whole diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and managing of it was by his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, and ſoveraign appointment (as we heard before); and thus it is no more abſurd to ſay, that God took a courſe to ſatisfie his own juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce, and to redeem us from himſelf, than to ſay, that a King doth ſo, when he gives his own ſon, to lay down
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:121171:86"/> his life,<note place="margin">Or a Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, when he requires the debt of his own Son, for which the ſon was ſurety by the Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</note> for the ſaving of Traitors from the ſtroak of his Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Man being thus obnoxious to the juſtice of God, and therefore delivered up by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Sathan, as his jaylour, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, to keep him as his priſoner, till he ſhall pay the uttermoſt farthing; and Sathan being alſo his deadly enemy, and unwilling to let him go; in this reſpect there is a neceſſity of an heavenly might to be put forth, for reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor priſoners from him, that they may be actually, and thoroughly redeemed.</p>
                  <p>But here again ſome may ſay, There is no need of any ſuch Conqueſt or Reſcue; for when juſtice is ſatisfied, then the priſoner muſt be diſcharged, and the jaylour can hold him no longer: ſo Chriſt having paid the debt, and given full ſatisfaction to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Law for the ſin of man; God doth now diſcharge the poor ſinner; and how can the Jaylour of hell hold him under his power ſtill?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Admit for the preſent, that <hi>[de jure]</hi> he cannot, hee ought not to keep ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners under, now that the ranſome is paid; yet for all that, <hi>[de facto]</hi> indeed he doth it, and will do it, till he be forced to let them go. Let us ſuppoſe a jaylour, having notice of a Goal-deliverie to be ſhortly, or having received a writ for ſetting at Liberty ſuch &amp; ſuch priſoners by name, ſhould yet 1. wilfully refuſe, yea oppoſe, and reſiſt the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof with force, and armes. 2. ſerve himſelf of them, and ſtrive to keep them in

                  <p n="2">2. As for that branch of the Objection, that upon Chriſt's paying the ranſome, God doth diſcharge the ſinner, it may not paſs for a truth, without ſome explication. It was not the minde of God the Father, or Chriſt the Mediatour, that this benefit ſhould actually inure to the Elect, immediately from the time of the payment it ſelf: God did determine, and preſcribe a certain order, &amp; way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould come to the perſonal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and have it laid in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes; which will be at the time of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective converſion of every of them,<note place="margin">I ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. I add this third conſideration. The bondage and ſlaverie under which wretched man lies through ſin, although it may be truly ſaid to be forced in reſpect of Sathan, yet as to ſinners themſelves, it is voluntary.

This way was the will of God, and none other, and therefore this way Chriſt took, and none other, and thereby attained his end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9, 10. We may ſafely reſt here, and make no further ſearch; for who hath known the mind of the Lord? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:121171:88"/> His meer will, and pleaſure,<note place="margin">Volunt as Dei eſt pro lege, pro cauſa cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarum, pro ratione ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum.</note> is a reaſon abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient, and beyond exception.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord hath revealed his minde ſo farr in this particular, that we may be bold to go a little further, and to reſolve thus. God, who is great in counſell, and excellent in working, had ſtore of means at hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſet free, and recover loſt mankinde; yet he was pleaſed to pitch upon this, as being moſt agreeable to his holy nature, and moſt ſuteable to his high, and ſoveraign ends, man's ſalvation, and his own glory.</p>
                  <p>I explain it thus. God is infinite in all his attributes, in his juſtice, as well as his mercy. Theſe two cannot interfeere; as juſtice may not intrench upon mercie, ſo neither may mercie encroach upon juſtice; the glory of both muſt be maintained. Now by the breach of the Law the Juſtice of God is wronged,<note place="margin">Nec miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia Dei praeſcribit juſtitiam, nec juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> ſo that, although mercie be apt to pardon, yet Juſtice requires ſatisfaction, and call's for vengeance on ſinners. Every tranſgreſſion muſt receive juſt recompence. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2. and God will not in any caſe abſolve the guiltie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. till this be done, the hands of Law-mercy are tied, that ſhe cannot act. And ſeing ſatisfaction could not be made to an infinite Majeſtie, but by an equal perſon, and price, therefore the Son of God muſt become a Curſe for us, by taking our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and pouring out his ſoul to the death; and by this means Juſtice, and Mercie are reconciled, and mercy hath her free courſe to ſave ſinners.</p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:121171:89"/>
                  <p>So that now, preſuppoſing God's Decree, we may ſafely ſay, It muſt be thus, and it could be no otherwiſe. God will have his Juſtice ſatisfied to the full, and therefore Chriſt muſt bear all the puniſhment due to our ſin, or elſe God cannot ſet us free: For he cannot go againſt his own juſt will.<note place="margin">Quod vuli, neceſſe eſt eſſe.</note> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the force of that phraſe <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26, &amp; 46. <hi>Chriſt ought to ſuffer:</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.24. <hi>Thus it muſt be.</hi> A juſt earthly Prince holds himſelf bound to inflict puniſhment imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the malefactour, or his ſurety; it ſtands upon his honour, he ſaith, it muſt be ſo, I cannot do otherwiſe.

                  <p>And as this great deſign of Chriſts redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners, by being made a curſe for them, doth ſound out aloud the glory of divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo it alſo bears viſible characters of ſome other Attributes: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His Truth. He had paſſed a peremptory doom, and made a ſolemn declaration of it in his word, that he that ſinneth ſhall die the death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21, 23. and he will not break his word. So he had foreor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Jeſus Chriſt, and ſet him forth to take upon himſelf this burthen, to become a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for ſin through his blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. and made known his minde eoncerning it in his written word, plainly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. If we read the words, [It is exacted, or ſtrictly required] meaning,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exigitur.</hi> as <hi>Junius,</hi> and ſome others.</note> the iniquity, or puniſhment of us all, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. is required at his hands, he muſt anſwer for it in our ſtead;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:121171:89"/> and ſo he is afflicted, and this affliction reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth even to the cutting him off, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. yea the Spirit of Chriſt in the Prophets, did ſignifie unto them not onely his ſufferings, but alſo the very particular time of them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. Therefore when Chriſt puts this work upon an [ought, and muſt be], hee laies the weight of all on the Scriptures, [thus it is written] as we may ſee in the texts before-cited, as if he ſhould ſay, God hath ſpoken it, and his truth ingageth him, to ſee it done.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His wiſdome. For hereby, 1. he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the authority of his righteous Law, when a law is ſolemnly enacted, with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty in caſe of tranſgreſſion, all thoſe, whom it concerns, may conclude for certain, that the Lawgiver will proceed accordingly: And it is a rule in policie, That Laws once eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and publiſhed, ſhould be vigorouſly preſerved. If the Lord ſhould have wholly waved the execution of the Law upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or their ſurety, it might have tended greatly, both to the weakening of its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the diminiſhing of the reverence of his Soveraignty in the hearts of the ſonnes of men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He provided a curſe againſt Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Impurity is apt to lay the reins looſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the necks of ſinners. If ſin had been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, without exacting the penaltie of the Law, it might have emboldened men in their ſinfull wayes, their hearts would have been wholly ſet upon miſchief, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11. they will ſay, <hi>Where is the God of Judgement?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:121171:90"/> Mal.</hi> 2.17. But now he lets ſinners ſee, that he will not pardon ſin, no not to repenting perſons, but upon condition of Chriſt's bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curſe for them; whence they may conclude, that he will not ſpare them, if they be bold to continue in their rebellion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And probably, that he might hereby alſo cut of all occaſions, which the devil his enemy might take to calumniate, and traduce him. He might accuſe him 1. of inconſtancy, and changeableneſs; that having threatned death to tranſgreſſours, he did quite forget himſelf, in waving the threatning, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing wholly with his Law, by granting them free remiſſion: Yea, 2. of partiality, and reſpect of perſons, that he ſhould be ſo eaſie, and forbearing, as to let them paſs without any puniſhment at all,<note place="margin">Quaſi tam facilis fuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, antea ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. His goodneſs, and loving kindeneſs. God the great Lord, and Governour of the world might have rigorouſly exacted the penalty of the Law, on the perſons of ſinners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but he hath ſo farr diſpenſed with the Law, as to admit of a Suretie, by whom the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:121171:90"/> end of the Law, that is, the manifeſtation of his juſtice, and hatred of ſin, might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and yet a conſiderable part of mankinde might be preſerved from the jaws of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, which otherwiſe muſt have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed eternally. Saith the Lord, I may not, I will not ſuffer this high affront of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his poſterity, againſt my holy Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the honour both of my juſtice, and truth are in danger, to be trampled under foot. And yet if I ſhould let out all my wrath upon them, the ſpirit would fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16.

               <p n="1">1. THis main Goſpel-truth may afford us ſome help towards the Confutation of the damnable Doctrine of two grand Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the croſs of Chriſt, and of this great and glorious work of Redemption, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a curſe for us.</p>

Papiſts, who not being content with this way of Chriſt, have deviſed other means, and put into the hands of ſinners ſomething elſe to make up the price of their Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They preſent us with ſeveral parcels to this purpoſe; as,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. <hi>De poenitentia. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2, 3, 6, &amp; 7.</note>1. That a man may redeem himſelf from the temporal puniſhment of his ſins, by ſome notable and extraordinary good works, while he lives, as by faſting, pilgrimages, almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, building, and endowing of Churches, hoſpitalls, and the like. They grant, that Chriſt by his ſufferings hath made ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on immediately, for the guilt of eternal death; but then, when the ſin is remitted, there remains ſtill on the ſinners, an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to temporal puniſhment, for which we muſt make ſatisfaction our ſelves, one way, or other; and ſo in part redeem our ſelves.</p>
               <p>But oh, where ſhall we find that man, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Jeſus Chriſt,) that can ſhew us ſuch a good work? Verily, the beſt, choiceſt, the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenteſt works of any meer man, that ever the Sun ſaw, or ſhall ſee, are poor, weak, blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things, like a menſtruous cloth, infinitely ſhort of the puritie of God's Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no way equivalent to the injurie done to him by ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is a Purgatory-fire, wherein all thoſe muſt be purged,<note place="margin">

               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:121171:91"/>
               <p>But the Scripture holds forth nothing to us concerning this; nay it affords us many ſtrong arguments againſt it, if it were worth the while, to produce them. They ſay, this fire, is every whit as hot, as hell-fire; but I am confident, it never burnt any body, nor do I know, to what uſe it ſerves, but onely, to warme the kitchin of that Man of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is a certain Treaſury in the Church,<note place="margin">Idem. De In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But this is no better than the former. For beſides that Chriſt's ſatisfaction (although in it ſelf infinite) hath nothing more in it than needs, as to the application of it to thoſe, for whom God did intend it; where ſhall we finde the man, that hath done, or ſuffered more then he ought to have done, or deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſuffer?

               <p>In a word, all theſe are meer fancies, yea, lying vanities, which cannot ſtand with this Truth. For if Chriſt was made a curſe for us, and thereby hath wrought our Redemption; then either there is no other way to effect it in whole, or in part, or elſe it will follow, that Chriſt's work is imperfect, which who dares once imagine? As for us we may aſcribe to the Pſalmiſts Reſolve, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 49.7, 8, 9. No man can redeem his brother: If not from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death, how much leſs from eternal? we ſhall leave theſe offals to the dogs of <hi>Rome,</hi> for we have enough in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Socinus,</hi> and his followers, who teach, that Chriſts becoming a Curſe for us, and the whole courſe of his humiliation in doing, and ſuffering was not at all for ſatisfaction, but onely to ſet forth himſelf to us an example for our imitation, and in his own perſon both by doing, and ſuffering, to ſhew us the way to heaven.</p>

               <p>But to go no further than the Text. There be three expreſſions, which they wreſt for the ſupporting, and maintenance of their Errour.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He was made a curſe: True, ſay they, as he was made ſinne, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. that is, hee was judged by men to be a ſinner, and he was uſed accordingly; ſo he was accounted a curſed man, and therefore was ſentenced to ſuffer a bodily death on the Croſs, which was a death proper to an accurſed perſon. But this falls ſhort, for God (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) made him to be ſin, and conſequently a curſe for us. Man was no more but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, ſinfully acting what God had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily purpoſed, and Chriſts voluntarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Beſides, the Text which is here cited from <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 21.23. runs thus <hi>[He that is hanged, is the curſe of God, or a curſe unto God]</hi> which being applied to Chriſt, can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no leſs than this, that God laid upon him our ſin, and the puniſhment due unto it by the doom of his righteous Law, that the pleaſure of the Lord, might be executed upon him, for anſwering whatſoever the Law could exact.</p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:121171:94"/> He bare the curſe, and gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in our ſtead.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Hereby he hath redeemed us from the curſe. Being made a curſe for us, he brought us out of the hands of the curſe, ſo that God was moved hereby to ſet us free from the guilt and puniſhment of our ſin. Here they bring two things to darken the clear truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the terme of Redemption,<note place="margin">Apud Grot. in defenſ. c. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> muſt be taken improperly for a deliverance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price, or ſatisfaction, ſuch as that of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Egypt,</hi> whom God redeemed by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet he paid no price, nor gave in conſideration, either by death, or otherwiſe for the compaſſing of it.</p>
               <p>To this we ſay, when the Scripture makes Redemption the effect of Chriſts bearing the curſe, of his ſuffering death, of the ſhedding of his blood, &amp;c. it can ſignifie no leſs, than redemption in propriety of ſpeech, that is, the freeing of poor ſinners from the ſtroak of juſtice by giving due ſatisfaction. This high extraordinary cauſe ſhould in all reaſon produce a nobler effect, than ſuch a looſe and frozen gloſs gives to it. Yea how doth this derogate from the worth of that glorious benefit, to ſay it comes at ſo cheap a rate? As for the redeeming of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was a type of our redemption by Chriſt, yet wee know, that the type, and thing typified, do not anſwer one another in all things. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> are compared
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:121171:95"/> as Redeemers, but with a vaſt difference, both as to the nature of the thing, and the ſpecial means by which it was effected. That of <hi>Moſes</hi> was onely corporal, from the ſervitude of the body; This of Chriſt, is chiefly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual from the bondage of eternal death. Therefore there was no need that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould dye for them; and if he had, as it could have been no way effectual to their ſpiritual deliverance; ſo it might (probably) have been rather deſtructive to their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral freedome. But Chriſt our Redeemer muſt neceſſarily dye for us, elſe no poſſibility of our redemption at all.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We finde that Chriſt is called our Ranſome, which is never ſpoken of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that is enough to ſhew, that there is an huge diſtance betwixt them even in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Redemption.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Apud eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note>2 That this Redemption is aſcribed to Chriſts ſuffering an accurſed death, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, but of us; that is, not that God was moved hereby, as by a valuable conſideration to ſet ſinners at liberty, but onely that they might thereby be brought effectually to the enjoyment of it, by faith, and obedience.</p>
               <p>To this we anſwer, that the bringing of ſinners to enjoyment of this benefit, is not the next, and immediate effect of Chriſts death; that belongs to the application, which ſuppoſeth Redemption in being; for the thing muſt be, before it can be applied.</p>
               <p>Now the Scripture doth every where make
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:121171:95"/> Chriſts accurſed death the next, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of the benefit of Redemption, but to the application, and perſonal poſſeſſion of this benefit its onely a remote cauſe. There be ſundry others nearer, even in reſpect of the Redeemer himſelf, as his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Interceſſion, the publication of it by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit to make it effectual. So that, our redemption is aſcribed to Chriſts accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death primarily in reference to God, the Lord and Law-giver, that his juſtice might be ſatisfied, and but ſecondarily, and at a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance in reference to us, that we might reach to the enjoyment of it.</p>
               <p>Much more might be added, but I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to thoſe godly learned men, which have purpoſely confuted them. I have no delight to rake in this dunghill, nor would I have inſiſted thus much upon it, but for theſe two reaſons, becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1 I conceive it to be a fundamental falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, undermining the very being of the Goſpel, and pulling down the chiefeſt pillar of our ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Yet this ſoul-killing plague having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, is dangerouſly ſpread abroad in this wanton licentious age, and too many of all ranks are infected with it.</p>
               <p>Yea, there is a ſtrange generation of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> lately ſprung up, which have borrowed their abominable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and wilde practiſes from other ſects, and patched them up unhandſomely like a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:121171:96"/> beggars coat. Among other errors, they broach us this down right Socinianiſme,<note place="margin">See the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Phariſee Poſ. 5.</note> That Chriſt in the fleſh, with all that he did, and ſuffered therein, was but a figure, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an example, whereby both Maſters and Scholars, do with one blow deſtroy the ſatisfaction, and merit of Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the whole work of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Let us abhor this damnable doctrine, and cleave to the truth of Scripture, which is delivered in ſuch plain and familiar expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as cannot without too much impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and palpable wreſting be eluded. Truly, beſides many pregnant Texts in the New Teſtament, almoſt the whole fifty third Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> may ſerve for a ſufficient confutation of it. They might with a little diſhonour to Jeſus Chriſt ſpeak out, and ſay flatly, that he died not at all, as ſay, that he dyed to a ſmall purpoſe. But it is no marvel, if they that have robbed him of the truth of his God-head, do diſpoile him alſo of the principal office of Prieſthood, and the efficacy of his ſatisfaction with the choiſeſt benefits purchaſed thereby for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of loſt ſinners.</p>

Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, both God the Father in giving Chriſt to be a curſe, and Chriſt the Mediator in ſubmitting thereunto, had this great end all along in their eye, and upon their hearts (next to the greateſt end of all the glory of free grace) even the reſcuing of poor loſt ſinners from that helliſh ſlavery wherein the curſe of the Law had intangled them. Oh the rich love of the Lord our God. It was the fruitful womb which did firſt conceive, and then warm, and at length in the fulneſs of time bring forth this heavenly birth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. &amp; 4.9, 10. Should an earthly Prince disburſe a great ſumme of money, of his own accord, undeſired, for the ranſoming of a company of ſlaves, which were not only ſtrangers, but alſo enemies to him, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe being convicted Traitors, and ſo continuing: this would be accounted an act of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:121171:97"/> ſuch ſingular clemency, as could hardly bee paralleld by any report of ſtory. What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful loving kindneſs then is this? that the Prince of the Kings of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. hath laid out the price of his deareſt blood for the redemption of the backſliding trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous brood of <hi>Adam,</hi> and is found of them, that ſought him not, that never looked after him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The work of Redemption is a very coſtly peece, a buſineſs of infinite charge. The Redeemer muſt be no meaner perſon than the Chriſt of God: the price to be paid, no lower a price, than the accurſed death of the Croſs. Might not the incomparable dignity of the perſon have diſpenſed with the means of the price? or the extraordinary coſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the price, have over-weighed the means of the perſon? ſo that either a lower price from a perſon of ſuch eminent worth, or a meaner perſon paying ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary dear price, might have ſerved the turn? Oh no, neither of theſe. If the whole world, yea ten thouſand worlds, with all the riches, and treaſures of their ſeveral Indies had been laid down upon the naile for this ranſome by the greateſt Potentate, that ever the earth knew, they would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, as falling infinitly ſhort. It was a moſt coſtly Redemption, and ſo we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. We reckon of our earthly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,<note place="margin">Can. 8.7.</note> libertie, immunities, freedomes, according to the rate which they coſt, if wee know they coſt a great price, we value them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:121171:97"/> the more. He that ſaid, he had bought his <hi>Roman</hi> freedome with a great ſumme, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.28. did prize it accordingly; even ſo, and much more ſhould we ſet an high rate upon this choice ſpiritual benefit, which coſt ſo vaſt a ſumme.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The grace of the Goſpel is a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing,<note place="margin">Out of the eater came meat, &amp;c. Iudg. 14.14.</note> for it is the purchaſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and the ſumme and kernel of the work of Redemption. The curſe of the Law did even break his bones, and this hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a ſpring of ſpiritual marrow and fatneſs, wherewith the ſoules of dry empty ſinners might be both filled and ſatisfied. Were it not for this, there could be no grace, nor mercy, we ſhould never have heard of any ſuch thing as the Goſpel, to bring the glad tidings of peace, and ſalvation to the loſt world, but every mothers childe of us had continued in the bond of iniquity, and had ſuffered the extremity of the curſe in our own perſons for ever. For this is the very next bottome, whereupon all Goſpel-grace, and whatſoever is neceſſary to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſinners, doth ſtand; and as it were the ſoul from which it hath both being and breathing. The excellency of the cauſe hath a ſtrong influence into the effect, to make it excellent alſo. If we look upon the nature and frame of man in the firſt Creation, his body curiouſly wrought out of the duſt of the earth, his ſoul breathed into him from heaven, to be both a living creature, and made after the Image of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. &amp;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:121171:98"/> 2.7. and all this done with a word; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſay, it is a very excellent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious work. <hi>David</hi> ſtands wondering at it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.14, 15. How much more excellent and precious is the work of grace, which is the fruit of Redemption (our ſecond Creation?) for the effecting whereof, the Lord did not onely, Let it be, but (as if that were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient) the ſecond perſon muſt lay aſide his glory, and take upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and not onely bear our nature, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our ſin and curſe, even to the death <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8.

                  <p n="1">1 REdemption by Chriſt, hath theſe three excellent Properties.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Its free and gracious. As the Iſraelites ſold themſelves to their corporal enemies for naught, ſo we became ſlaves to our ſpiritual
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:121171:100"/> enemies without price, and as they, ſo we are redeemed without money, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it coſt Jeſus Chriſt the price of blood in an accurſed death, yet it was according to the riches of Gods grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. In regard of Chriſt our Surety, it was not free, but dearly bought; for as Almighty God, the perſon offended, did require ſatisfaction to be made to Juſtice; ſo Chriſt undertaking for us, anſwered his demands accordingly. But in all other reſpects it is free. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of ſuch a thing, as Redemption for loſt ſinners, the providing of ſuch a Surety to undertake the work, the managing of it all along in ſuch a way, as it might not faile of its accompliſhment, the accepting of it when it was done, for full ſatisfaction, the particular application of it to the needs of all the Elect, all theſe were acts of free grace and mercy. Poor ſoul, the Lord doth not expect the worth of one farthing from thee, towards the purchaſe of thy Redemption; Look thou upon it, as the meer fruit of rich grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is full and plenteous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.7. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath gone thorough-ſtitch with it, he hath done it to the full, for there is no defect or flaw in it at all. He doth not work one, or ſome few parts of it, making an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance for us, and leaving us to grapple with the reſt, to bear the heat and burden of the day, and to wraſtle out as we can; but he makes compleat work of it, he redeems us from all our iniquities, he delivers us out of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:121171:100"/> hands of all our enemies, he takes off from our backs the whole curſe, and ſets us in a ſtate of true freedom. Therefore in the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it home to poor ſinners, they are ſaid to receive abundance of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. I grant, it is not made out to us at preſent in all the parts and degrees of it, but it ſhall be entire and perfect in heaven; there ſhall not an hoof be left behinde. Take it in the whole from firſt to laſt, and it is every way plenteous, he will ſave to the uttermoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is eternal, and without period, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. The liberty whereinto Chriſt Jeſus brings the Elect, is permanent, it ſhall never turne into bondage, it abides irrevocable, and unchangeable to all eternity. The Jews which had ſold themſelves to bee ſervants, were to be ſet free at the Jubilee, yet that Jubilee laſted but for one year, therefore the ſame perſons might afterwards become bondmen again; but this acceptable year of the Lords Redeemed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.2. &amp; 63.4. is an everlaſting year, it ſhall never end, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall never be ſubject to bondage any more. When the Lord would comfort the Jews with hopes of a return from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> he uſually annexeth Evangelical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, reſpecting the deliverance of poor ſinners from the ſlavery of Satan, whereof that captivity was a type; ſome of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes do plainly expreſs, the perpetuity of that ſpiritual freedome, which they ſhall enjoy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.6. &amp; 60.19, 20. <hi>Jer.</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:121171:101"/> 31.11, 12. &amp; 32.39. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.25, 26. &amp; 39.29, and theſe ſhall begin to be fulfilled moſt viſibly at the calling of the Jews.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Redemption by Chriſt doth beget, and bring with it many rare ſpiritual benefits. It is a rich Mine, containing a maſs of treaſure of unſpeakable worth. Could we dig into it, we might finde variety of the choiſeſt pearls, in compariſon whereof, the moſt orient pearles, that this world can afford, are no better than droſs. What the Lord ſaid once to his Anointed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a temporal deliverer of his people, the ſame he hath ſpoken much more to his Anointed Jeſus, the Churches great Redeemer. <hi>I will give thee the treaſures of darkneſs, the hidden riches of ſecret places,</hi> Iſa. 43.3. Theſe are the unſearchable riches of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Suſcepit mala noſtra ut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That we may rightly underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe ſeveral benefits, in reference to the mother-benefit from whence they ſpring, I ſhall briefly make way to them by theſe three conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Redemption that is in Chriſt, hath in it not onely ſatisfaction,<note place="margin">Impunitas, &amp; pramium</note> but alſo merit; from the former ariſeth freedome from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment; from the latter the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of everlaſting reward. Hence it is, that ſome benefits conſiſts in deliverance from evil, and others in beſtowing of good things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 As the woful condition of the ſons of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:121171:101"/> men through ſin is made up of two ſorts of evills, ſome referring to what they are in Gods account, others to what they are in themſelves; anſwerably the condition, whereinto Redemption brings them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of two ſorts of benefits. 1 Relative, importing a change in Gods account of them. 2 Real, ſtanding in an alteration of qualities in themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The benefits which flow from Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do not immediately follow the ſufferings of Chriſt on the Croſs, ſo as thereby, and thenceforth to be actually exiſtent, and to enure to all the elect, but are onely made feaſible by them, yet ſo, as to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated infallibly in due time. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the womb of redemption, but yet their ſeveral births are according to the time of life; I mean, they are in it virtually as the fruit in the ſeed, but not actually laid in the boſomes of ſinners, till redemption it ſelf be applied unto them. I may compare the whole fabrick of the ſalvation of ſinners to a mighty tree; the root of it is upward in heaven, the decree of it election; the boil of it is redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having many ſpiritual benefits, as ſo many branches growing out of it, virtually contained in the boil, breaking forth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving their ſeveral fruits to poor ſinners at the time of their converſion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being premiſed, let us take a view of them, as they are ſcattered here and there in the Scriptures; I ſhall preſent them in that order, which I conceive to be moſt proper.</p>

Reconciliation: This is ſo near a kin to Redemption, that for ſubſtance, it is the ſame, differing onely in ſome reſpects. As treaſon, murther, or the like crime commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Law of the Magiſtrate, doth not onely make the offender liable to the penalty of the Law, but alſo ſets them at a diſtance, and provokes the wrath of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate againſt him: Even ſo, the ſin of man did not onely make him a priſoner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe of the Law of God, but brought on a wofull enmitie betwixt God, and him. The Scripture often preſents the Lord diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with ſinners, and gives all men (as they ſtand in their firſt birth) this Livery, that they are children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and his wrath is revealed from heaven againſt ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. yea, the Lord is ſaid to hate not onely ſin, but ſinners, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.15. and they are called haters of God,<note place="margin">

In the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> he diſclaimes us as baſe Rebels, but in the ſecond he owne's us, as reconciled friends. Let the Lord's Redeemed ones lift up their heads, and know their happineſs. Jeſus Chriſt hath ſlain the enmity, which was betwixt God and you. This price of Reconciliation hath broken down the wall of ſeparation; and although the Lord be ſtill a conſuming fire, marching againſt the briars and thornes, and burning them altogether, yet even then he ſaith to his vineyard, <hi>Furie is not in me.

                  <p n="2">2. Remiſſion of ſinnes. This goes hand in hand with reconciliation. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. As the violation of the Law of an earthly Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, brings upon the offender (beſides the Governour's diſpleaſure) an obligation to puniſhment, and when that obligation is voyded, then he is ſaid to be pardoned: ſo man's diſobedience againſt the great Lord of heaven and earth, did oblige him to ſuch puniſhment as the royal Law had threatned; but Chriſt our Surety, by bearing it for us, hath voided that obligation, and ſo we are diſcharged from it, and in this ſtands our Pardon. Therefore the Apoſtle joynes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and Remiſſion together, as being (upon the matter) both one. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:121171:103"/> 1.14. and expreſly aſcribes them both to his blood, as the meritorious cauſe.</p>

                     <q>Whence (by the way) we may diſcover the weakneſs of that <hi>Socinian</hi> Argument, againſt Redemption by Chriſt's ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe our Redemption is called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. For where ſatisfaction is made, (ſay they) by undergoing due puniſhment, or paying a valuable price, there is no place for pardon. But ſurely the Holy Ghoſt knowes better then we how to ſpeak properly. It's Redemption by his blood, and yet it is forgiveneſs of our ſinnes. And their argument hath more ſhew then weight: For this ſatisfaction was not made by paying the very ſame, but the as much, not the proper ſtrict debt, which the Law changeth upon the ſinner, but the full va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue or weight of it, with ſome alteration. The Law ſaith, The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die: even the ſelf ſame perſon, and it muſt be death eternal, becauſe the ſinner can never pay the uttermoſt farthing. Had this been, there had been no place for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.<note place="margin">Pſa. 69.4.</note> But now Chriſt comes in, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily undertakes to reſtore the things, which he took not away, that ſinners, which took them away, might be ſet free. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a ſubject hath committed a crime, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in rigour of Law perpetual impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment; if now the King's Son be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to undergo 6 moneths impriſonment in his ſtead, which (conſidering the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the perſon) is as much, as a mean
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:121171:103"/> man's ſuffering it during life; the King indeed may refuſe this way of ſatisfaction, becauſe it is not the very letter of the Law; but if he accept it, what doth it import leſs, then a pardon to the ſubject? This is the Caſe. The Son of God giving himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, doth in a ſhort time wraſtle through, and maſter thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which would have maſtered ſinners, and hold them under to all eternity. Now although Almighty God, the great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver might have refuſed this kinde of payment, as not being the very ſame, which the Covenant of works exacteth; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not onely conſented, but deviſed and ſettled it, as the moſt covenient way for the ſecurity of ſinners, and the manifeſtation of his glory, thereupon he is well pleaſed with it, being as full ſatisfaction to juſtice, as if the ſinner had ſatisfied in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So that the Lord's accepting of it upon this account is ſo far from excluding remiſſion, that it rather makes way for it, and gives it a being. This appears further by the Apoſtles ruled caſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22.<note place="margin">See Jun. <hi>paral. &amp;</hi> Pareus.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding of blood no remiſſion, which holds both in Legal ſacrifices, and in the great ſacrifice of Chriſt, typified thereby, as the ſcope of the place ſhews.</q> But to return,</p>
                  <p>The Law chargeth the curſe upon the ſons of men. The Lord Jeſus takes the curſe upon himſelf, and thereby makes an end of ſinnes, for this was one of the works, which he was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:121171:104"/> to do, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. the debt being paid, the book is croſs'd, the bond is cancelled. No forfeiture to be taken, no penalty to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone. Let wretched ſinners take notice of their happineſs in this alſo. Chriſt was ſent to purge away all your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1.7. Pſal. 65.3.</note> Redemption blots out all your Items, and layes up pardons in heaven for your uſe, to be readie for you, in the time of need.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Juſtification of our perſons. Obligation to puniſhment doth imply liableneſs to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and condemnation for the offence, which deſerves ſuch puniſhment. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Law of God finding man a tranſgreſſour; and ſo unrighteous, threatens death as his due: And in order to the inflicting of it, ſtands up as an Accuſer, and paſſeth ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt him. Now Chriſt, being made ſinne, and a curſe in the ſinners ſtead, doth thereby with one, and the ſame labour, both ſet him free from the puniſhment of ſin, and acquit him from the accuſation, and condemnation of the Law: Whereupon he may plead, that although the demerit of his ſin doth crie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud for puniſhment, yet it is not due to his perſon, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath borne it for him, and made full ſatisfaction to juſtice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. The Apoſtle makes juſtification an effect of the Redemption, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. the Meſſiah was to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6. a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Branch is promiſed to be raiſed up to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:121171:104"/> 
                     <hi>David,</hi> and his name ſhall be called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> our Righteouſneſs. And thus he is made of God to us Righteouſneſs. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. When the offence is taken away by a pardon, the perſon is accounted righteous. Therefore the not imputing of ſin, and the imputing of righteouſneſs go together, as it appears by the Apoſtles explication of the Prophet <hi>David</hi>'s meaning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. <hi>Romans</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. God ſees no iniquitie in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and when the ſins of <hi>Judah</hi> are ſought for, they ſhall not be found, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20. underſtand this not in regard of the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinacie and blameableneſs of the acts, nor yet ſimply, in reference to the juſt deſert of ſin conſidered in it ſelf (for theſe are of the very nature of ſin, and cannot be ſeparated from it) but in reſpect of the particular guilt, and puniſhment of thoſe perſons, which being taken away, they do thereupon ſtand right in the Court of heaven. We ſee it here in Courts below, if nothing come in againſt a man, if there be no accuſer, he is quit, and ſtands as innocent in point of Law, as if he had not been queſtioned: So, when Chriſt hath by his ſatisfaction diſabled the Law, from giving in any evidence againſt the poor ſinner, he then is abſolved, and ſtands clear before the great Judg: when the Lord hath found a ranſome, then he doth not onely ſay, Deliver the ſinner, but he ſhews unto him his uprightneſs, that is, he makes him partaker of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iob 33.23, 24. &amp;c.</note> and ſo looks upon him as righteous, through his
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:121171:105"/> ſatisfaction. This was one end, why the Lord made Chriſt ſin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 21. Let the poor convinced ſoul take notice of this alſo. Thou feeleſt much guilt on the ſpirit, thou groaneſt under it, and feareſt damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but here is thine acquittance. When the poor woman's accuſers were ſlunk away, Chriſt ſaid to her, <hi>Woman, hath no man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned thee, neither do I, John</hi> 8.10, 11. ſo ſaith the Lord to thee: See poor ſoul, the Law ſaith nothing againſt thee: the mouth of thine accuſers are ſtopp'd, none can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee, neither will I: yea, thou mayeſt make the ſame challenge, that the Apoſtle make's, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to my charge? God juſtifies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34.</p>

But the ſon of God manifeſted in the fleſh, hath not onely waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off our ſin in the guilt, and curſe due to us, but hath reſtored us to the dignity of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. This was one of thoſe high ends, which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:121171:105"/> the Lord had in his eye, when he ſent him in that humbled poſture, to redeem us, it was, that we might receive the adoption of ſonnes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up eight ſeveral honours, which God had conferred upon the people of the Jews, wherein they excelled all other nations, he ſett's adoption firſt, as the moſt eminent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. according to that <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Iſrael is my ſon, even my firſt born.</hi> This being but an external dignity, to continue for a time till the partition wall ſhould be broken down, was a ſhadow, and reſemblance of that Goſpel-honour, which we have by the work of Redemption, even the right, or dignity to be the ſons of God. <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.12. the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the firſt born, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. and if children, then heirs yea joint heirs with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. for being now in Chriſt, and made partakers of his righteouſneſs, we have fellowſhip alſo with him in his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. This is a fruit of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace of Chriſt, and an high advance of the work of Redemption applied.

So that now we are every way dead (as to our ſpiritual eſtate), both by ſin, in the loſs of God's favour, which is better then life; and in ſin by the loſs of that conformity to him, which once we enjoyed. But our great redeemer frees us from this death, alſo by Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This was one end of Chriſts giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Church, that he might ſanctifie,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:121171:106"/> and cleanſe it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26. his death hath a ſoveraign vertue, to work the death of ſin, as his life, hath to work the life of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. He is made of God to us Sanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and now as there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt, ſo they are ſet free from the Law of ſin, and death, by that law of the ſpirit of life, which is in Chriſt; and all this ariſeth from God's ſending him to condemn ſin in the fleſh. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3. Chriſt was put to death in the fleſh, and for a requital he puts to death the fleſh, that is, the body of ſin in us. The law laid the Curſe upon him, and he having borne it, turn's it upon the Law of ſin, which is in our members, and blaſts that rotten ſtump, ſaying to it, as once he ſaid to the unprofitable fig-tree, <hi>Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 21.19.</note> and ſeting a new plant of holineſs in the ſoul, to bring forth fruit unto God. Indeed we ſee it not yet fully done, but the Curſe is gone out againſt the old man, and he is waſting, and ſhall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed in time. Let the Lords people ſee their happineſs in this alſo. Poor ſoul, thou cryeſt out unclean, unclean, I have a very foule naſty heart, my ſoule is a very ſtie of all uncleanneſs, I am carnal, fold under ſin,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.14.23.34.</note> I can do no good thing; Oh miſerable man, who ſhall deliver mee? why? Chriſt thy Redeemer hath made thee a new creature, he hath put into thee a principle of holineſs, and he is ſtill at work in thee, weakning ſin, by degrees, ſo that though it will dwell in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:121171:107"/> thee, yet it ſhall not over-maſter thee, nor bring thee under its feet. Corruption ſhall go down, and grace ſhall get up more, and more. The Lord Jeſus will not ſpare either pains, or coſt in proſecuting this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. he will wear of that filthy ſlough of the old nature, and the image of hell, and make thee partaker of the divine nature, that thou mayeſt be conformed to his own image, Sigh, and breath after it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Final Redemption. Which ſtands in the total removal, and abſence of all miſerie, and imperfection, begun at death, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, at the reſurrection.

                  <p n="1">1. To diſtinguiſh it from the firſt, and great act, wrought by Chriſt on the Croſs, to wit, Redemption by way of merit, whereon the main ſtreſs of the buſineſs lay, which was not intended ſo much for the body, as the ſoul, to deliver it from guilt, and curſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To intimate that part of Redemption, which we ſhall be partakers of by death, whereby we ſhall be ſet free, from manifold evils, and annoyances, which compaſs us about, and moleſt us, while we are in the bodie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe the accompliſhment of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit at the laſt day, ſhall be more viſible in the bodie.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:121171:107"/> their bodies. Theſe lying in their graves, as in priſon under miſery, ſhall then be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again to their ſouls, and ſo both ſhall be equally ſharers (according to their ſeveral capacities,) in this final Redemption.</p>
                  <p>So then, this is a certain effect, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the great work, wrought by Jeſus Chriſt, the price is paid for the whole and full deliverance ſhall come in the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; which is therefore called the day of Redemption. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. and Chriſt is made of God to us.

If we have our part in this Redemption,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12 1 Io. 3.2. two parallel texts.</note> let us ſtand a while, and conſider, what great things the Lord doth for us. We read of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſent away <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> her ſon with bread, and a bottle of water (and that by Gods own appointment) becauſe the Son of the bond-woman muſt not be heire with <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 21.10, 12, 14. And after that <hi>Iſaac</hi> had been reſcued from death by the offering up of a Ram in his ſtead, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.13. <hi>Abraham</hi> growing old, gave ſmall gratuities to the ſons of the Concubines, and ſent them away from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but unto him he gave all that he had; the inheritance was reſerved for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.5, 6. You that are ranſomed from the curſe by Jeſus Chriſt the great Ram of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, you only are the Lords <hi>Iſaac's,</hi> the children of the promiſe; The Ancient of dayes meaſures out to the men of the world, (the ſervants of ſin) ſome pittances of his

Oh then, let us contemne all worldly glory, let it fall out of our hands, and hearts, and let us rejoyce in the hope of this heavenly glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the rare ſpiritual benefits, which Redemption brings forth (ſeven fair Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of one bleſſed Mother.) Look upon them, and behold their beauty. Are they not exceeding fair? Incomparably lovely? Did you ever ſee any beauty like unto their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?

The benefits before mentioned give us a being, and ſtanding in the ſtate of grace.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:121171:110"/> portion. Let us make a little inquiry after them, and take a ſhort taſte of ſome of them for our uſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It makes us truly and properly bleſſed. The Apoſtle aſſures us of this in the next verſe <hi>[That the bleſſing of Abraham might come on us Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt]</hi> God had ingaged himſelf to <hi>Abraham</hi> by expreſs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.18.</note> that in his ſeed all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. that is, in the ſeed of the Woman, bruiſing the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. This bleſſed ſeed Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould deſtroy all Satans power, which he had over ſinners, by means of ſin, and the curſe, and thereby render them really bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And certainly thoſe, and onely thoſe are ſingularly bleſſed, which are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this Redemption. All other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs is but a ſhew, a ſhadow, a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſcarcely deſerving the name of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs. At the beſt, the world can hold forth, onely ſome poor ſhreds, or ſcraps, but the ſoul, and the marrow of it is here. The Elect are happily carried by the hand of their ſtrong Redeemer from Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> over the valley to Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 115.15</note> while their neighbours are left behinde under the curſe.

                  <p n="5">5 BY perſonal intereſt in the grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, we become the Lords free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. We were perfect ſlaves before; now we are brought into a condition of liberty, ſo that although we do not enjoy the whole length and breadth of it at preſent, yet we are free-men in right, and actually alſo in good meaſure. The Son hath made us free, therefore we are free indeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.36. Being ranſomed out of ſlavery into the dignity of children, we are accounted no longer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and therefore we are free, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.26. Although in reference to Chriſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, we are ſervants, he having all the right of power over us; yet conſidered, as now actually partakers of this glorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, we are his free-men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.22.</p>
                  <p>The Natives of a Kingdome are free by their birth-right, and ſo are thoſe, that are naturalized by ſpecial favour, or by a ſumme of money: We are not free-born, but by a vaſt ſumme paid out of Chriſts ſtock, we are naturalized, and ſo made Spiritual free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:121171:114"/> This Goſpel-liberty might be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in ſundry things; as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whereas in our old ſinful condition, we were wholly locked up in our ſpirits from God, and ſo clogged, that we could not walk one ſtep with him in his wayes; now the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt of our bolts being knocked off, we may walk, yea run in the way of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and not faint, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31, 32.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our hearts were altogether ſhut up from h m, ſo that we could not pray to him, being inſenſible of our needs, yea and the gate of heaven was faſt barred againſt us, that our petitions could not enter; now the Throne of grace is ſet open for us, and a ſpirit of liberty is put into us through the blood of Jeſus, that we may draw near with boldneſs, and confidence, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19-22. Our Redeemer aſſures us of ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his account, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 We had forfeited the right to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which God gave us in the day of our creation; now we have our Charter renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a full aſſurance of the free uſe of them, by a more honourable title, even the right of Chriſt our Lord Redeemer, whom God hath appointed Heire of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. and by him all things are ours, even things to come, as well as preſent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We were ſubject to the traditions and impoſitions of men, we bowed down our backs, and ſuffered them to ride on our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:121171:114"/> and to make us their vaſſals; now we are delivered from that ſervitude by the price which Chriſt hath paid for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. So that although we muſt needs bee ſubject to the powers ordained of God, even for conſcience ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5. yet not ſo, as to have dominion over our faith, but onely in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, as no earthly freedome can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice Chriſts intereſt in us, as his ſervants; ſo neither can any earthly obligation hinder us from having our ſhare in this honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his free-men.</p>
                  <p>Beloved Chriſtians, take notice of this for your ſelves, Liberty is a thing very deſirable; all men would be free. This you have by Chriſt in a moſt excellent manner. All other liberty in compariſon of this is no better than pure villanage. Oh that we could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it! and improve it to advantage.</p>
                  <p>All the promiſes of God belong to the Lords Redeemed in a ſpecial manner. They are primarily intended for them, and made unto them; they are authentick onely in, and through him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. and therefore claimable onely by thoſe that have intereſt in him; yea all the marrow, and goodneſs of them ſhall be given in unto them, and laid in their boſomes onely, as their proper por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Promiſes of ſpiritual bleſſings, the love and favour of God, acceptation of their perſons, and ſervices, pardon of ſin, power againſt ſin, an heart of fleſh, heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

                  <p n="2">2 Promiſes of temporal good things are theirs alſo.

The promiſes even of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour good things are fruits of the Lords ſpecial good will, and therefore proper to the Redeemed.</p>
                  <p>The Old Teſtament promiſes pertained to the Iſraelites, and ſevered from the reſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:121171:115"/> of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. all others being ſtrangers to them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the New Covenant belong to the Lords Redeemed, as ſevered from all the ſervants of ſin; therefore they are called Heirs of Promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. When the Lord ſaith, thoſe that ſeek him, ſhall want no good thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. and he will with-hold no good thing from them that walk uprightly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. he fixeth the propriety in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo deſcribed, as thoſe onely that can groundedly claime them; and this right to the promiſes, ariſeth upon the account of his giving his Son to death for us, this being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly the greater favour, and therefore he will not ſtick to give us the leſſer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. And now, dear brethren, which are now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the great benefit of Redemption, much joy may you have in this ſweet privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. In the volume of Gods book you have a treaſury of promiſes, which is able to afford you a rich ſupply, whatſoever your needs are. Oh, that we were ſo wiſe, as to get acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, and to make them familiar to our ſelves, that we may know where to finde every Jewel, and every Ear-ring, and every Bracelet, to deck our ſouls with on all needful and convenient occaſions.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 By the grace of Redemption, we come to have a peculiar intereſt in the providence of God. Our Apoſtacy in <hi>Adam</hi> deprived us of our beſt ſafety, for thereby we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Holy One to leave us to ſhift for our ſelves, and not to take care of us any

But now the Lord Jeſus, by paying our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome from the curſe, hath renewed our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the providence of God, ſo that he looks after us, and watcheth over us in a ſpecial manner for our good. It is ſaid of the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> that it is a Land which the Lord cared for, his eyes were alwayes upon it from the beginning of the year to the end of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.12. It is true much more of the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> the inviſible Church, whereof that was a type. His ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial providence is at work for the whole, and every particular member of it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Hee will keep his Vineyard of red wine both night and day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.3. This is the Theme, or Argument of the 90. and 121. <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> where it is largely handled. And the Apoſtle ſaith, That God is the Saviour of all men, ſpecially of them that beleeve, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.

                  <p>All the parcels of this precious priviledge flow from the Redemption, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.

                  <p n="1">1. Redemption by Chriſt is the opening of a ſluce, for the waters of life, to run amongſt the Gentiles. The Prophets are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in holding forth this priviledge, that ſtrangers ſhall come in, and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.43. &amp;c. all the ends of the earth ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.2, 3. the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,<note place="margin">Pſal. 86.9.

This was the work of Chriſt our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſo it was propheſied. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Shiloh,</hi> ſhall come, and to him ſhall be the gathering of the people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.27. <hi>David</hi> tells us, that all the ends of the earth ſhall turn to the Lord, and that upon this ground, becauſe he is King and governour among the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. but how comes he to this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie? it was the conſequent of his great ſufferings, which are largely deſcribed before, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.14, 15. the Lords ſervant ſhall have his viſage marred, (by a deep humiliation) yet he ſhall ſprinkle many nations. God gives Chriſt for a Covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to bring out the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the priſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, 7. There was a famous propheſie of the ſhining of great light upon the people, that walked in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:121171:118"/> 
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.2. this was fulfilled, when Chriſt ſojourned in <hi>Capernaum Matt.</hi> 4.13, 14. By the blood of Chriſt, the middle wall of partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being broken down, thoſe that were far off, are made near. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13, 14. and ſo no more ſtrangers, but fellow-citizens, with the Saints, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.20. therefore Chriſt having ſaid, I lay down my life for my ſheep, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adds, I have other ſheep, which are not of this fold; them alſo I muſt bring, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 10.15.16. This is a great priviledge, and ſo to be accounted. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calls upon us gentiles to glorifie God for his mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.9. &amp;c. for alas what would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed of us ſinners of the Gentiles, if this Redemption had not opened a door of hope, we had been left as dead bones, altogether helpleſs, and undone for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its the foundation of that general Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which God is pleaſed to ſtrike with all thoſe, whom he makes willing, to come in, and to joyn themſelves unto him in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible profeſſion of his name, and with their ſeed both of old among the Jews, and now with all nations, to whom he ſends the Goſpel. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preſſeth the men of Judea, and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, to a thorough entertaining of Chriſt, by this argument, becauſe the promiſe is general. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. which implies, that Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified is the baſis of the Covenant. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was a viſible ſign of the external Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereby God owned the Jewiſh nation for his people above all others, therefore
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:121171:119"/> its called the Covenant it ſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11, 13. and Baptiſme now is a viſible ſign of it, to all thoſe throughout the world, which ſubmit to the Goſpel. Both theſe inſtitutions have reference to Chriſt, as the inward mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſubſtance of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we are ſaid to be circumciſed in Chriſt, and by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of Chriſt; and to be buried, and raiſed again with him in Baptiſme, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. Aſſuredly, if the Lord Jeſus had not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, to buy out ſinners from the curſe, by becoming a curſe for them, there had been no ſuch thing as a Covenant. God would never have owned any of the ſons of men, in order to eternal life; no, nor ſo much as have ſuffered them to be called by his name, But now by the work of Redemption, all that are retainers to Chriſt, in the viſible Church, (though ſtrangers to the life of grace,) have ſome kinde of right to all Church-ordinances,<note place="margin">Jus ad rem. <hi>if not</hi> in re.</note> and are allowed a ſhare in ſundrie boons of favour; they may get a general acquaintance with Chriſt, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſome common graces, whereby it may go better with them, and they are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the kingdome of God, than thoſe that are mere ſtrangers; Oh, take heed of ſlighting this mercie, If the Lord will vouchſafe to own you, and your ſeed in the way of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, thereby making you (in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) capable of the choiſeſt good things, even heaven, and eternal life, you may thank your redeemer for this: and if you do not improve it to better proficiency, to raiſe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:121171:119"/> you to an higher forme in his ſchool, and kingdome, it will make a ſad reckoning one day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſhall be by the all-ſufficient merit and vertue of the grace of redemption, that the people of the Jews (once the people of God, but now rejected, and under wrath for their unbelief, and hatred againſt the Lord Jeſus) ſhall be called to the knowledge of the truth, and obtain mercy; and the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall be brought in, to make up one glorious Church, and new Jeruſalem. There be many excellent promiſes, in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Prophets which hold forth both theſe: The reſtauration of the Lords ancient people, is plainly foretold, in thoſe texts, which I have formerly made uſe of, on other occaſions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20, 21. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26, 27. The Apoſtle cleares the meaning, of that propheſie, and applies it to the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Jews, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.35, 36. God will ſave Zion, and will build the Cities of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.22, 23. the priſoners ſhall be viſited after many dayes, and the Lord of hoſts ſhall raign in mount Zion, &amp;c. ſee alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.8.9. and 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.34, 37, 40. &amp;c.

Iſrael
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:121171:120"/> and Judah are held captives, but their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the Lord of hoſts is ſtrong, and will thoroughly plead their cauſe, &amp;c. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9, 11. it is by the blood of the Churches Covenant, that the Lord ſends forth her priſoners out of the pit:<note place="margin">Zach. 10.8.</note> yea, the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem ſhall look upon him, whom they have pierced, and mourn for him,<note place="margin">Mal. 4.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. the white robes of thoſe, which came out of great tribulation, were waſhed, and made white in the blood of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. which our <hi>Brightman</hi> referrs to the calling of the Jews. Oh, how glorious ſhall thoſe times be? when the light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun ſhall be ſevenfold, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.26. and he that is feeble among them ſhall be as <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.8. Let us long for this day, and have it much on our hearts. Pray the Lord, to bring again the captivity of his people, and to plant them upon their Land, to ſend forth watchmen, which may call upon the <hi>Shulamite</hi> to return.<note place="margin">Amos 9.14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Can.</hi> 6.13. and to ſtirr up remembrancers, which may give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh, and till he make Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The overflowings of this glorious work, do reach even to the bettering of the whole Creation. The whole company of reaſonable creatures, Angels, and Men, are the purpoſe of Jeſus Chriſt; he hath bought them into his own hands, to be their Lord, to poſſeſs, command, and diſpoſe of them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:121171:120"/> He commanded not onely the windes and the Sea, and they obeyed him, but alſo the evil Spirits, and they owned his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.27. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.35, 36. He bought even thoſe that denyed him 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. God's patience towards the wicked, preſervation of them, proviſion for them, their breathing in the air, treading on the earth, and the like common favours, are the fruits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Every Son, and daughter of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> is beholding to the grace of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for their very lives, and their repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val from the damnation of hell: yea, were it not for this, the whole world might (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably) have been turned into a Chaos again. It's certain, that this great viſible fabrick, with all the creatures in it, both living, and liveleſs, Sun, Moon, Starres, Elements, Plants, &amp;c. is ſubject to vanitie; God hath ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it, in his juſt judgement, for man's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie. So that it lies under the bondage of corruption, the creatures have loſt much of their beauty, and virtue; they are forced to do ſervice to the ſervants of ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45. The good things of the earth are put to bad uſes,<note place="margin">

The creature was made for man,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:121171:121"/> and as it became a ſharer with him in the bondage of corruption; ſo it ſhall be alſo (according to its capacity) in his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and glorious liberty to come. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, &amp;c. How this ſhall be, by what means, and in what manner, it is not eaſie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Some think, by a total abolition of the ſubſtance; and if it ceaſe to be, it ceaſes to be under bondage. The moſt ſay, by an alteration of qualities; it ſhall be ſo changed, as it ſhall ſeem to be, not the ſame, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Scripture tells us, that the heavens, and earth that are now, are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be burnt, with fire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.10. which (ſay they,<note place="margin">So ſome expound <hi>Job</hi> 14.12. ſee <hi>Caryl</hi> on that text, at large.</note>) is meant of their purgation, not their annihilation. Howſoever it be for the manner, the thing is without queſtion, the creature ſhall be delivered.</p>
                  <p>Now this priviledg flowes from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought by Chriſt. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As it was man's ſin, that brought the curſe upon the creature: ſo the taking away of the ſin of man, is the taking of the curſe from the creature; even as the reſtoring of a Traitor is the reſtoring of all that depends upon him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The preſent Liberty, and glory of the ſonnes of God is an effect of Redemption: therefore ſo is the Liberty, and glory, which the creature ſhall enjoy, with them; this being an appurtenance to that, and as the ſhadow to the body.</p>
                  <p>It behoves us to take notice of this for our ſelves. It ſhould ſadden our hearts, when we
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:121171:121"/> conſider, that the Creature fares worſe through our Apoſtaſie; and yet it may rejoyce us, that it fares better by our recovery.</p>
                  <p>But I have dwelt too long on the uſe of Information: I ſhall therefore diſmiſs it, and proceed to another.</p>

Art thou a greater ſinner then <hi>Manaſſeh?</hi> Read his ſtory, where the Holy Ghoſt points him out in his black, and ugly colours, and tell me, if thou didſt ever hear of ſuch a monſter: yet the fruit of this Redemption reached even unto him: for upon his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, the Lord was intreated of him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. thy greateſt ſinnes are finite, but the merit of Chriſt's redemption is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. If ſome mountains were removed, and hurled into the great Ocean, it would ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them up, that they could not be ſeen: So the Sea of Chriſts bloud will drown the huge mountains of thy iniquities. Though thy ſinnes be as ſcarlet, thy Redeemer will make them white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. Oh then! never lay the weight of thy guilt in the balance with Chriſts ſatisfaction, never fear, that that will overweigh this. Thy ſurety
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:121171:122"/> hath made thy peace for the greateſt, as well as the ſmalleſt faults. He was charged with thy moſt heinous crimes, that thou mighteſt be delivered from the curſe of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The multitude, and numerouſnes of them. Though I have not committed ſuch greiſly enormous ſinnes, as ſome others have done, yet I have made that up in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is wanting in weight: my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions are manifold, yea innumerable, more than the haires of mine head, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. or the ſands that are on the ſea ſhore. Be it ſo, But doſt thou think, that they are more than Chriſts merits? Hath he born in his body, and made ſatisfaction for all the ſinnes of all the Elect, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the laſt man on earth, and doſt thou fear, thy ſinnes are ſo very many, that this ſatisfaction cannot reach to take them away: The Apoſtle comparing the guilt of the firſt ſin with the free gift by Chriſt, gives the preheminence to this, in that the former brought condemnation for one, but this latter brings juſtification for many offences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16. and Chriſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies of the woman that was a ſinner, that her ſinnes which were many, are forgiven her, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. Be thy ſinnes never ſo many, if they fill a roll, that reacheth from the Eaſt to the Weſt, or from earth to heaven, they can but wrap thee in the curſe, and Chriſt hath taken upon him the whole curſe, that he might redeem thee from it, If thou haſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied to ſin, God will multiply to pardon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. he will caſt all our iniquities into

If thou ſhouldeſt fill a thouſand baskets with ſand, and caſt them all into the midſt of the Sea, the waves would ſo ſweep them all away, that no remnant of them would appear, ſo the ſtreames of Chriſt's blood are able to waſh away thy manifold ſinnes, that not one of them ſhall remain: When the dew is fallen upon the ground, thou mayeſt ſee infinite millions of drops, but when the Sun breaks out, and ſhines in its ſtrength, it licks up, and ſcatters them all in a very ſhort time, and thou ſeeſt not one left: So the Sonne of righteouſneſs can diſpel thy numberleſs tranſgreſſions, as a cloud, or a miſt, that they cannot be found, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Long continuance in the ſtate and trade, and under the guilt, and power of ſin. Oh, I am a ſinner of a long ſtanding, I am old and aged in ſin,<note place="margin">Ierem. 2.33. Ier. 22.21. Eze. 23.43.</note> I am ſoaked in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, I have ſerved many apprentiſhips in it, and am grown gray-headed, I have drawn out a long train of vanitie, and ſin, as it were with cartropes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.18. Methinks, I feel the guilt of it ſo ſodered into my ſpirit by dayly cuſtome, that it cannot be plucked out. But ſtay a while, poor ſoul, if the Lord hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to draw thy heart to ſeek an intereſt in the grace of Redemption, let not this diſmay thee. Although thou haſt ſpent all thy dayes in a courſe of ſin, ſpun out a long thread of iniquity, lived under guilt, even to the age of <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> yet the Redemption that is in Chriſt is richly able to ſet the free. He, to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:121171:123"/> whom a thouſand years are but as one day, can take of thy guilt of 1000 years ſtanding. There were means for cleanſing an old Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie of long continuance, and ſacrifices to be offered to that end, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.11. and 14.2. The Iſraelites after the death of every Judge returned to their old trade of ſin, and ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not from their ſtubborne way. <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.19. Yet the Lord ſtirred them up Saviours ſtill; and though thou haſt continued long in ſin, yet Chriſt continues ſtill a Saviour. The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that is 100 year old, is accurſed. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.20. but the curſe which thy Redeemer did undergoe, is ſtrong enough to ſhatter in peices the moſt inveterable curſe, and to turn it into a bleſſing. The removal of guilt ſo deeply rivetted into thy ſoul by length of time ſeems to thee impoſſible, but to him all things are poſſible. To ſhut up this, I would have the humbled ſoul to reſolve thus; Chriſt Jeſus hath offered up himſelf to God through the eternal ſpirit; and wherefore thus? ſurely, that he might by his blood purge my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, from dead works, and ſo deliver my ſoul from that eternal guilt, and curſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is intrapped. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The advantage which Juſtice might have againſt the ſinner, for rejecting, or neglecting the offer, and ſeaſon of grace. Oh, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hath the Lord made a render of ſalvation to me by the Goſpel? how affectionately hath he invited me to come in, and to take hold on the ſtrength of this great Redeemer? yet I have reſiſted the ſpirit, and trampled this great
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:121171:124"/> grace under my feet, or at leaſt ſlighted it ſhamefully; therefore I have cauſe to fear, that the time is paſt, and that mercy ſhall never reach to my ſoul. Had I thoroughly cloſed at the firſt call, or ſeen ſome reaſonable time to lay down armes, and ſubmit, I could hope, that the Lord would have paſſed by all my former offences: But that he ſhould now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept me after the abuſe of ſo much mercy, ſuch unprofitableneſs under his ordinances, ſtrong oppoſition againſt grace ſo unwearied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered, and ſettling my ſelf on the lees of mine old ſinful condition, contrary to the light, which I had received, this is quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mine expectation. Theſe and the like aggravating circumſtances cannot but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate divine Juſtice, and even compel it to vindicate its own honour, and to avenge it ſelf on ſuch a notorious wretch, as I am: Surely the Lord hath determined to glorifie himſelf in my finall condemnation. Thus the poor afflicted ſoul is apt to plead againſt its intereſt in this redemption. But oh my dear heart, be not ſo peremptory; open thine eyes &amp; thou ſhalt ſee mercy glorying againſt Judgement. <hi>James</hi> 2.13. None of theſe ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations ſhall obſtruct the ſweet fruit of this glorious benefit, but it ſhall break through them all. True it is, one of the Lords ends in ſuffering ſin to abound, and ſhewing forth ſo much patience to ſinners, is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting of his Juſtice upon the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. as in the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 9.16. But what is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:121171:124"/> this to thee, who haſt laid down thine armes, and art gaſping for mercie? He hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and a more deſirable end in reſpect of thee, namely, that grace may much more abound, and may raign thorough righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. And what wilt thou ſay, if the glory which he gets by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering thee from the curſe, be double to that, which he might have by leaving thee under it. By this he onely glorifies his juſtice, but by the former he glorifies both his juſtice, and mercy, this, in reſcuing thee from guilt, and wrath: that, in laying the curſe upon his onely Son, that mercy might have free way to ſerve thee. Why then doſt thou not rather conclude thus? ſurely the Lord which doth all things for his own glory; will more regard a greater then a leſſer glory, my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart ſaith, it will be his choiceſt glory to deſtroy me, being guiltie of ſuch foul rebellions: But the mercy of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer ſaith, No, not ſo, I have borne the whole curſe for thee, that juſtice might have no advantage by thy rebellion; therefore I will rather raiſe up my glory by thy delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

Oh ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. But pauſe a while, and take one thing with another. Thou thinkeſt thou art ſtill under the Curſe, while the caſe is thus with thee: but it is not ſo. The great deſigne of thy Redeemer in deſtroying ſinne, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering thee from it, doth not take place fully whileſt thou art in this mortality. His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not, to remove it wholly out of thy ſoul, ſo as no footſtep of it ſhould remain, but onely to take away the ſting, and deadly ruining power of it for the preſent: The to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal aboliſhing of it muſt be a gradual work, not to be perfected till thou ſhalt put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption. Thy happineſs here ſtands not in the not having ſin, but in the Lords not imputing of ſin, through the ſatisfaction of Chriſt. It is the wiſedome of our heavenly Father, thus to exerciſe thoſe, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to be veſſels of mercy; He will have their remaining time here, to be a warfare, that they may know the fellowſhip of Chriſts ſufferings. He was burthened with thy ſin, and could not be rid of it, till death: thou muſt be conformed to thine head, and make account it will be thy neighbour, while thou
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:121171:126"/> art in the body. But remember, that while thou art yoked with this body of ſin, and groaning under it, thy Redeemer hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on thee.

But ſtay a while, and hearken what the Lord will ſpeak to thee. It is a ſad thing that Chriſts free-man ſhould be ſo hankled in a ſnare, and ſo trampled under the feet of a maſterful luſt; and more ſad, if he ſhould lay under the power and command of a groſs ſin in the actual committing of it, yet there is hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning this: Onely take notice, that I have no deſigne to bolſter up the ſinner in his way of inquity, my endeavour is to ſpeak peace to the diſconſolate Saint.

If the Lord hath reverſed, and diſanulled his juſt ſentence, paſſed againſt thee in heaven, will he ſuffer the unjuſt ſentence of ſinful man on earth to ſtand in force againſt thee? If the curſe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:121171:129"/> which is deſerved ſhall not come, much leſs ſhall that which is cauſeleſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.2. Say thou to God, as <hi>David,</hi> Let them curſe, but bleſs thou, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.28. thou mayeſt hope, that the Lord will requite thee good for their curſing, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12. when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and upon their way to the promiſed Land, <hi>Balaam</hi> was hired to curſe them; but the Lord turned the curſe into a bleſſing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.3, 4. So if thou be redeemed out of thy curſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and art travelling heaven-ward, thou ſhalt meet with curſes by the way, but thy Redeemer will turn them into a bleſſing; yea he hath bleſſed thee already, ſo that all their imprecations, cenſures, ſlanders, are but the flaſhings of powder without ſhot, or like ſquibs, which breath out fire, but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly vaniſh and dye. Thou mayeſt pitty their folly, in ſpeaking evill of the things which they know not. The day is comming, wherein they ſhall hang down their heads for ſhame, and ſay, We counted their life mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but indeed we are the mad-men, they are the Lords Redeemed, and numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints, we are the Devils bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and muſt go in the black band.

You that are happily reſcued from the Curſe and bondage of hell, may expect to meet with much tribulation in the way to the Kingdome of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. But this may be your comfort, Jeſus Chriſt your ſtrong Deliverer looks after you, and will not ſuffer you to be trodden under foot, Hee is the Captain of your ſalvation, and he knows by experience, what it is to be afflicted; for the Father thought it moſt convenient, to make him perfect by ſufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. and he hath drunk the bittereſt cup even to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, and will ſo ſweeten yours, as you ſhall have no cauſe to ſhrink at it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall inlarge this further in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. Not to inſiſt on ſuch grievances as the godly ſuffer in common with the men of the world: The grace of Redemption affords ſome reliefe againſt theſe. There be three ſorts of Afflictions very remarkable, which
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:121171:130"/> do oftentimes deject and weaken the ſpirits of Gods people, ſo that they need to bee comforted with the ſavoury, and reſtorative Apples which grow upon this Tree.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Perſecutions for righteouſneſs. By this excellent benefit we are made capable of high enjoyments, but it is with the proviſo of ſuffering perſecutions, ſo hath Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf determined, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.29, 30. and his choſen witneſs <hi>Paul</hi> tells us poſitively, <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.13. which hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly verified in all ages. See <hi>Davids</hi> complaint, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.20, &amp; 119.86. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. But now the Saints which ſuffer for the truth, or for well-doing, may chear up their hearts, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Redeemer himſelf hath led them the way in this fiery trial. Did ever any undergo ſo much? his whole life was a continued perſecution. <hi>Herod</hi> ſought his life while he was a childe, and when hee was grown up, the Jews perſecuted him to the death; and he hath given us warning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, that we may not think it ſtrange, if we be baptiſed with the ſame baptiſme, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.20. Let the poor ſuffering Chriſtian then reſolve thus,<note place="margin">Luke 4.28, 29. Ioh 5.16, 18. and 8 59. &amp; 10.30, &amp;c.</note> If my Redeemer was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake, in defence of his heavenly doctrine, the avouching of his eternal God-head, the Fathers ſending him to be the Saviour of the loſt world, and the doing of good works, and all this for me, and on my account; then it is but equal, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t I
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:121171:131"/> ſhould undergo any kinde of perſecution for him, and not ſtick at it. This is but to help to fill up the remainder of Chriſts ſufferings, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. and for thine encouragement take notice that he hath pronounced thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that are thus perſecuted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.10, &amp;c. Look up unto him, <hi>who for the joy that was ſet before him, indured the Croſs,</hi> Heb. 12.2. and do thou likewiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Sufferings in their innocency. The godly are expoſed to hardſhips in the world, not onely for bearing witneſs to the truth, and for well-doing, but alſo when there is no cauſe at all, ſave the unreaſonable will and malice of men. Thus it was with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 13, 4. &amp; 35.7. &amp; 59.3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.11. <hi>They lurk privily for the innocent without cauſe.</hi> So <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> Gen. 39.8, 12, 20. and <hi>Daniel</hi> 16.4, 16, 22. Some men are ſo malignantly affected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſincerity, that rather then fail, they will forge, and invent matter of miſchiefe againſt the godly. If this be thy caſe, thine integrity, and innocency may bear up thy ſpirit; thou needeſt not fret againſt the Agents, but conſider that the Lord hath an hand in it for thy good, at leaſt for the trial of thy faith, ſelf-denial, patience. Above all, remember, that this alſo was the lot of thy Redeemer. He had no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth, yet he ſuffered; he was brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, yet ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he not his mouth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22. Say then, Although I ſuffer without cauſe, yet I will not be caſt down, but I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:121171:131"/> my way unto the Lord, and he ſhall bring forth my righteouſneſs as the light, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5, 6. The Redeemer which pleads my cauſe with God, will plead it alſo with men. Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine enemy, when I fall, I ſhall ariſe, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.8. He will awake to judge my cauſe in due time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Puniſhments for ſin. The Redeemed of the Lord, by giving way to the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the wicked one, and the prevailing of luſt, do ſo far forget themſelves, that they even waxe wanton againſt him, and provoke him to take them underhand, and to inflict ſome judgement upon them. Thus he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>David</hi> for his ſin in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.10, 11, 14. and <hi>Moſes</hi> for not ſanctifying him before the people, <hi>Num.</hi> 20.12. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.50, 51. and the Saints of <hi>Corinth</hi> for unworthy communicating, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. which is called judging, verſ. 31. The godly ſometimes by their miſcarriages bring upon themſelves, ſickneſs, poverty, loſſes, croſſes in children, or good name, yea bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death. By complying with the ſins of the times, they become partners in the judgements, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.3. Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it, as very remarkable, prefixing a <hi>[Behold]</hi> to it, that the righteous ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced in the earth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.21. even he is not ſpared, but paid home for his folly; there is a time, that judgement begins at the houſe of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. Say then, Is this thy caſe? Thou haſt ſinned, and now thou ſuffereſt. I adviſe thee to be humbled for
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:121171:132"/> it, yet not to be diſcomforted. The Redeemer hath born the heat and burthen of Gods wrath for thy ſin, and theſe puniſhments are not the effects of indignation ſteeled with hatred, but anger meekned with love.</p>
                  <p>Minde it, good Chriſtian, the Lord hath annexed this proviſo to the Covenant of grace, If you tranſgreſs, you muſt expect to be viſited with the rod, yet the Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 89.30. &amp;c. As poyſon duely mixed and ordered by the art of the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I might here take occaſion to ſtart and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute this queſtion, Whether thoſe which are actually made partakers of the grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, be ſo fully freed from the curſe of the Law in this life, that the evills which they ſuffer for ſin, have nothing of the curſe in them, nor can be truly ſo called: But I look upon it, as a ſtrife about words; the controverſie may be thus decided.<note place="margin">

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:121171:132"/> which is the reward of ſin, or ſtrictly for that great evil of evils, which ſtands in the ſeparation of the ſinner from God, and his eternal perdition.

I grant that the benefit of Redemption applied, is both a meanes to produce, and an help to advance this love: but when the ſoul begins to know Chriſt ſomewhat experimentally, then he ſees that beautie, and excellency in him, which renders him altogether lovely, <hi>Can.</hi> 5.16. now he loves him intirely, and longs to be more nearly united to him. He deſires not to be delivered from the curſe, and ſo to be righteous, and holy, that he may have an intereſt in Chriſt. That is not his method: But <hi>contra,</hi> he deſires to have real intereſt in Chriſt, that he may be freed from the Curſe, and ſo be clothed with his righteouſneſs, and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in holineſs,<note place="margin">Bona tua non niſi tecum, Domine.</note> If thy heart can ſay yea to this, thou haſt an evidence of ſincere love to Chriſt: but if thou loveſt him
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:121171:134"/> onely for lumps, for the benefits which thou getteſt by him, deliverance from hell, and the glory of heaven, thy love is mercenary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Superlative. It tranſcends, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops all the Love of the creature. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ſoul loveth wife, children, friends, his own life, and the good things of this world according to their ſeveral degrees of goodneſs, and he loves them, (not fainedly, and in ſhew, but) truly and indeed, within due limits, and in ſuch proportion, as they are capable of, but yet he loves Jeſus Chriſt farre, and farre above them all; This love leaves all other loves many thouſand miles behinde it, ſo that none of them can come near it. He is precious, (ſingularly precious,) to them that believe: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. he is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, they have a very high eſteem of him: His intereſt prevailes in their ſoules infinitely above all other intereſts, in the world. Chriſt diſownes, yea rejects all love tendred to him, which is inferiour to the love of our deareſt relations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. yea, we muſt hate theſe in compariſon of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. Ask thy ſoul, what it can anſwer to this? Doth thy ſoul ſet an high price on thy Redeemer? Doth thy heart embrace him as incomparably excellent? doſt thou finde the enjoyment of him more ſweet, and contenting, than all other enjoyments? and his abſence, hiding of his face, and reſtraint of his gracious influences from thy ſpirit, more bitter, and grievous then all other
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:121171:135"/> wants, or burthens, which thou mayeſt meet with? But if thy heart ſet up any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him, ſo that Chriſt and his partie, when they ſtand in competition with ſome other partie, which hath gotten the chair in thy ſoul, are ſlighted, and muſt ſit at its footſtool, or be thruſt out of doors: Oh, this is a baſe beggarly love, which will not ſtand thee in ſtead.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Invincible. To clear this: the love of Chriſt in an elect perſon, actually redeemed, may poſſibly be overcome by the prevailing of the contrary corruption. It is not ſimply impoſſible, being a created quality, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more able to ſtand of it ſelf without divine ſupport, than <hi>Adam</hi>'s love to his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, which was ſo eaſily maſtered, by the ſuggeſtions of the ſerpent, to the ruine of himſelf, and his poſterity: yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this poſſibility, it ſhall never be totally vanquiſhed, and loſt in the ſoul. It may be greatly decayed, and driven into a corner: ſo that the godly Chriſtian may want the ſence of it, and may verily think, that the love of Chriſt dwelleth not in him at all; yet it is there, and ſhall abide in him for ever. This fire, (as that on the Altar) ſhall never be wholly extinguiſhed, Becauſe the Spirit of God, which firſt kindled it, is ſtill preſent, blowing it up leſs or more, that it cannot die. It's a part of the ſeed of God, which abides in the ſaints and preſerves them from ſinning unto death, which they muſt needs do, if the love of the Redeemer, be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:121171:135"/> totally routed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. It's a ſtream flowing from the well of water, which ſprings up in the believer unto everlaſting life. <hi>John</hi> 4.14. The world thruſts ſore at this love, that it may fall. Proſperity on one ſide preſents the beautiful and pleaſing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of riches, honours, eternal delights,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.24.</note> to draw the love of the ſoul to themſelves. Adverſity on the other hand, will endeavour to affright the ſoul from the love of Chriſt, by the ſterne and unwelcome ſhapes of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, afflictions, perſecutions, and death it ſelf; yet it's bow abides in ſtrength, by the hand of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Saints love not their lives to the death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. becauſe they love the Lord Jeſus, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> loved <hi>David,</hi> not onely, as their own ſoules, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.17. but alſo with a wonderfull Love. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.26, <hi>Jonathan's</hi> Love to <hi>David</hi> was admirable in this, that it could not be taken off, either by the frowns, threats, and violence of his Father, <hi>Saul</hi> againſt <hi>David,</hi> and againſt himſelf for adhering to <hi>David,</hi> or by the conſideration of his own intereſt, which was deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this buſineſs, he being heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Crown, and <hi>David</hi> ſtanding in his light: ſo the love of the right Chriſtian, to Chriſt cannot be wholly overcomed, by temptations on the right hand, or the left; it can envie, and deſpiſe both the ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting of pleaſure, and the bitter affronts of danger; and keeps its ground in ſome good meaſure againſt them all. Love is ſtrong
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:121171:136"/> as death, the coales of this fire make a moſt vehement flame; many waters cannot quench it, nor the floods drown it, <hi>Can.</hi> 8.6, 7. Trie thy ſelf, if this be thy temper, thy love is right bred: but canſt thou give way to any thing in the world, to take off the edge of thy love to Chriſt? This fire which is ſo ſoon put out, came not down from heaven. Yea (minde it) thou loveſt Chriſt, but thou feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not a return of love from him to thy ſoul; yet if thy love be incorrupt, thou wilt ſtill hold on, in priſon, as well as Liberty, in death as well as life, it will not be quite tyred out by long delay of comfort; but the hope of an anſwer of peace, will keep it acting, in thee, and the dayes of thy waiting, and ſerving him will ſeem to thee but a few, for the love thou haſt to him, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Accompanied with ſelf-jealouſie. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the love of the godly ſoul to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer be thus divinely qualified, yet he hath, &amp; keeps up within himſelf an holy ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion concerning himſelf, that he may work out his own ſalvation (now actually begun) with fear and trembling;<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> Look as it is with a poor maid, who is deeply in love with ſome young man of Eminent parts. She conſiders the great worth, and excellencie of the perſon, and her own means and unworthineſs: She ſees a vaſt diſtance betwixt her ſelf and him, ſo that ſhe ſhall never be able to anſwer him according to his condition; hence ſhe apprehends ſome danger of miſcarrying, leaſt he ſhould reject her, and her love ſhould be loſt: yet ſtill her
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:121171:136"/> affection goes out freely towards him, and he hath her whole heart; only ſhe ſees cauſe to fear, leaſt ſome undue or uncomely carriage of hers, ſhould diſpleaſe him, and provoke him to diſtaſte her; and this fear makes her the more cautelous, and helps her to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give him all poſſible contentment, that ſhe may not fail of her deſires: Thus it is with a poor ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> now made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of Redemption by Chriſt; he is greatly in love with his Redeemer, but conſidering the great inequality betwixt them, and his proneneſs to offend, he is jealous over his own baſe heart, leaſt ſome unworthy walking ſhould give his love the lie, and Chriſt the dearly beloved of his ſoul ſhould turn him over to Sathan again, and leave him to be a ſlave to ſin, and the curſe; or leſt his love ſhould decay, or cool, and Chriſt his onely one ſhould be diſpleaſed at him, and frown upon him. The Gentiles grafted into the Olive-tree, muſt not be high-minded, but fear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. Such are pronounced bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. If <hi>Paul</hi> was jealous over the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> much more might they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2, 3. If this jealouſie be a ſtranger to thee, thy love may well be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                  <p>By theſe ſignes thou mayeſt trie the truth of thy love to Chriſt, and if thou findeſt this frame of ſpirit, thou mayeſt conclude, that thou art redeemed. A love thus qualified, is a ſure evidence of thy Redemption. For none can poſſibly love the Redeemer at this
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:121171:137"/> height, but thoſe, which are actually parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the benefit. By nature we do not, we cannot love him; onely the banner of his love in the work of Redemption, diſplayed to the ſinner by the ſpirit of God, drawes his heart to love him. It may be, thou haſt no aſſurance of any intereſt in this benefit: but if thou findeſt in thy ſoul ſuch an high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Chriſt, and grace, and ſuch an adviſed complacency of ſpirit in him, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines thee to fix the deareſt love of thy heart upon him, (notwithſtanding the contrary ſtruglings of the fleſh within thee) though it certainly draw after it the loſs of all worldly intereſts whatſoever: I ſay, if this be thy frame, thou haſt no cauſe to fear thy condition.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:121171:138"/> taken quite away, yet, Oh how noiſome would it be? It would make a man wearie of himſelf. Thus it is with the ranſomed ſoul. The bulk of the fleſh (as I may call it) is deſtroyed by the croſs of Chriſt, the life of it is (in a great meaſure) laid in the duſt, when he is ſet free from the Law, that is, the commanding, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling, maſterfull power of ſin; yet ſtill the members of this carkaſs, the affections and luſts of the fleſh, are ſprawling and ſtirring, and working in him; and theſe are as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to a gracious heart, as the ſtinking members of a dead body would be to a living body, if they were coupled to it.

So that thou thinkeſt not, willeſt not, affecteſt not as they do, but goeſt in an higher orbe? thy converſation is more in heaven, than in earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20.

Doſt thou walk as a man? Are thy words, actions, aimes like thy neighbours? Are they no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor higher than other mens? Why, then it ſeems, thou art ſtill in thine old bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Walking in, and after the Spirit. The walk of the natural man, who is the Devills bond-ſlave is in, and after the fleſh. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt wiſdome of the old man, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. is his light, and the will thereof, is the very life of his ſoul. He
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:121171:140"/> hath neither light, nor life within him, avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſalvation; the inſtinct and dictatings of his fallen nature, carry him on in his whole courſe. But when the grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is brought home to the ſoul, and the Son hath ſet him free, then the Spirit of the Son (who of a ſlave hath made him a Son) doth animate, act, lead, and guide him all along in the reſidue of his converſation, according to that remarkable promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. and the Apoſtles grave Aphoriſme, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14 The fleſh abiding in him, will be ſtill luſting againſt the Spirit, and drawing him out of his way; but his frame, bent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and conſtant endeavour, is to be at the direction and appointment of the Spirit in all his wayes: He looks upon the fleſh as a very bad guide, and not to be truſted, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if at any time he be miſled by it, when he perceives it, he turns away from it, with ſorrow for his folly. It is the Spirit of God, which he chuſeth for his guide; unto it ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the word he repairs continually for counſel, and reſignes himſelf up to follow it in all things. This is the ſignal evidence, which the Apoſtle gives of thoſe that are freed from condemation by Jeſus Chriſt, and he makes it out upon this ground, Becauſe the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath freed them from the law of ſin and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3. When the Angel of the Lord had rowſed up <hi>Peter</hi> in the priſon, and cauſed the chaines to fall off from his hands, he gave him a command to follow him; <hi>Peter</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:121171:141"/> being now ſet at liberty, goes after him from one place to another, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.7, 8. &amp;c. Even ſo, when the Spirit of God hath looſed a ſinner from his bonds, by ſetling upon him the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Redemption, he is then fit, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to walk after the ſame Spirit from one ſtage of duty to another. As in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Spirit, that was in living creatures, acted the wheels to go when they went, and to ſtand when they ſtood, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21. So the members of Chriſt, are carried on by the breathings of his Spirit dwelling in them, in all their wayes. But take notice, that it is not a private ſpirit, but the Spirit of God ſpeaking in the word, not a ſpirit oppoſed to the Scriptures, but the Spirit ſpeaking in the Scriptures, which is the Guide, whom the Redeemed follow. The word of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in them, is the breathing and voice of the Spirit; the ſame ſpirit preſents the way of God preſcribed in the word, to the eyes of the minde, and then bows the heart to the obedience of it, ſo that the Soul ſaith, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.9. Chriſts ſheep hear his voice, by his Spirit ſpeaking to the Churches, and they follow him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7.

                  <p n="5">5. THis important Truth may afford us matter of very profitable exhortation. The knowledge of this main Goſpel-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, concerning the buying out of poor ſinners from the curſe of the Law, by Chriſts becoming a curſe for them, is very uſefull for all the ſonnes, and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> to excite them to ſuch duties, as are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their preſent conditions reſpectively. None of <hi>Adam</hi>'s brood, but it hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſay to them:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It cries aloud in the ears of ſenſleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which lie ſecure in their old ſlavery, under the curſe, unto this day. Oh wretched creatures, what thing ſhall I take to witneſs for you? or what ſhall I equal to you?<note place="margin">Lam. 2.13.</note> What tongue can utter words, or what eyes can
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:121171:143"/> ſend forth tears ſufficient to lament your ſad condition? You lie bound hand and foot, under the power of darkneſs, and here is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to be had by Chriſt. Oh then, why will you chuſe to lie ſo ſtill, and not rather accept of ſeaſonable deliverance? Should a Prince ſend a meſſage to impriſoned Captives, that their ranſome is paid, &amp; they may come forth upon reaſonable termes, &amp; be freemen; if now none will ſtirr to embrace the offer, might it not well be thought, that either they are all dead, or in a deep ſleep, or ſtrangely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted. God ſends theſe glad tidings to ſinners, every day by the Goſpel, &amp; they never regard it. Either they ſay, as the Jews, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8.33. We are not in bondage; or they ſit ſecure, and ſay, no evils ſhall befall us. Wo, wo to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the world, which ſlight this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious grace, chooſing rather to lie ſtill under the brazen barres of the curſe of Gods fiery Law, which accepts of no man's perſon, and cannot admit of any plea of exemption for noble or baſe, rich or poor: All are alike, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. Oh what pittie is it, and how ſhould it humble us, even unto the duſt, to ſee ſuch a precious jewel trampled under the feet, or careleſly caſt behinde the backs of ſinners? to obſerve in the greateſt number ſuch an indifferency of ſpirit, as they are no whit affected with this pearl, that neither ſorrow for want of it, nor deſire to enjoy it, nor any ſerious regard of it can take place in their ſouls? that though they be told of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance by Chriſt, and profeſs, that they
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:121171:143"/> believe it, yet the Devil prevails with them to reſiſt their own good, and willingly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the chains of the curſe all their daies? I beſeech you, if there be any ſpark of lawfull ſelflove in your breaſts, if you have not wholy abandoned all compaſſion of your ſelves, and are become your own enemies, be awaked from your ſloth, and look about you. Do you thus requite the Lord Jeſus, O fooliſh people and unwiſe? Is not he thy father,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.9.</note> that hath bought thee? Rather, let my counſel be acceptable to you in theſe few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Give way to the Light, and authority of the Law, (in the miniſtry of it) to bring thee to a thorough conviction of thy miſery, and extream need of the help of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Think it not ſufficient that the Law hath lent thee light enough to ſay, All men are ſinners, and ſo to wrappe thy ſelf in groſs with them, and to be content to be reckoned among them, ſeeing thou canſt not avoid it, but bring it home to thy conſcience, believe thy ſelf to be his accurſed ſinner, and ſay, I am the man. Impriſon not the truth in unrighteouſneſs, but let it ſo overpower thy ſoul, that thou mayeſt be no longer able to reſiſt it, but mayeſt yield thy ſelf into the arreſt of God's juſtice, that the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage may cauſe thee to fear the curſe and wrath of God, and thou mayeſt lie ſlain,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.6.</note> and dead in thy ſelf, utterly unable to recover thy ſelf, and therefore helpleſs, and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as to thy ſelf, or any thing in the world. Let the Law have its free courſe to work thee
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:121171:144"/> into this frame. When the Lord meane's to apply the ranſome to a poor ſinner for his deliverance from the pit, he firſt open's his ears, and ſcale's his inſtruction, that he may hide pride from him, <hi>Job</hi> 33.17.-24. If thou be wiſe, thou wilt meet the Lord in this way; though it be unpleaſant, yet it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. But if thou either continueſt dead, and blockiſh under the diſcoveries of the Law, or favoureſt thy ſelf in thy ſloth, and eaſe, or lifteſt thy creſts in confidence of the ſafety of thy condition, there is no hope for the preſent of any ſaving good towards thee. And yet alas, how is the Spirit of the Law ſtraitened in theſe ſad times? Our people will not ſuffer it to come near them, much leſs to maſter them. If any thing be offered them in way of conviction, they either drown it in their cups, or ſing it away in merry Jiggs, or laugh it out of countenance, or (at the beſt) ſuffer it to wear off, and to die in their hands. But in the fear of God, beware of theſe things. I tell thee, thou mayeſt be quite diſmounted and caſt down, at the Lords feet: All wayes muſt be block'd up, whereby the carnal heart may take occaſion to nouriſh hope of eſcaping out of this priſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Being at this loſs, adviſedly reſolve, not to abide in this condition, but to make haſt out of it. Say to thy ſelf, O my ſoul, Where? in what caſe art thou? It's no tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying here: It's too hot to be under the curſe, in the flames of hell. Who can dwell with the devouring fire? with everlaſting

But oh, alas, if there be a Miniſter in the Town, an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, one that is willing, according to the meaſure of the gift beſtowed on him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the counſel of God to poor ſinners, how long may he ſit at home, before any of his neighbours will knock at the door, to tell him, that they are wretched priſoners, under the Curſe, and know not how to get out? yea, although he be accounted one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, ſcarcely four perſons in a whole twelve-moneth, will come to him, travelling under their burthen, and propounding ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe: Oh how ſhall I get from the Curſe of the Law? who ſhall draw me out of this woful dungeon, wherein I ly?

This is as an hand created in the ſoule, by the Spirit of God, to receive, and take home Jeſus Criſt the Redeemer, with all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits unto eternal life. It is, when a ſinner ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his ſinne, and the curſe, and ſo loſt in himſelf, renounceth his own righteouſneſs, and all creature-helps, and betakes himſelf to Jeſus Chriſt alone, accepting him as he is offered in the Goſpel, that is, both to be his Saviour, and his Lord; both to reſt upon him for righteouſneſs, and ſalvation: an to reſigne himſelf up to his Government, in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:121171:148"/> ſubjection to his Lawes. This is the Faith of the Goſpel, which, as it hath a ſpecial aptneſs,<note place="margin">in that it acts (as the eye ſees,) <hi>Non extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittendo, ſed intramit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendo.</hi>
                     </note> to be a mean of intereſſing us in the grace of Redemption; ſo we cannot doubt, that the Lord hath, put upon it this office alſo, to be after the manner of a condition, if we obſerve theſe Scripture-expreſſions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24. if we believe on him that raiſed up Jeſus, it ſhall be imputed to us for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou ſhalt believe in thy heart, — thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> and the want of this condition is threatned with death, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8.24. See alſo, <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.31. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37.</p>
                  <p>But 2. This faith towards the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, is ever accompanied with repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; which is called repentance from dead works, and coupled with faith in God, as twins in the doctrine of the foundation of Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. This is the ſouls irking with its former ſinfull eſtate, and wayes, and a deep diſpleaſure at himſelf for them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a forſaking of them, and turning away from them unto God, in the ſincere purpoſe of the heart, and ſerious endeavour of the converſation. And that repentance hath ſome hand in this buſineſs, to be a mean, (and as a condition too, in part,) of intereſt in Redemption, may appear by promiſes of mercie, pardon, and healing made to it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 28.14.<note place="margin">Iob 33.27, 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> 11.14, 15, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. and the contrary threatning, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. which plainly implies, that without this there is no eſcaping of perdition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no actual Redemption. So that, the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:121171:148"/> ſinner now, as by one hand of faith he takes Chriſt's Righteouſneſs unto himſelf; ſo by Repentance, as by the other hand, he thruſts away ſinne from himſelf, out of his heart, and hands, that he may enjoy a part in the grace of Redemption. Chriſt the Redeemer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made theſe the chiefeſt ſubject of his preaching, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. and ſo did his Apoſtles, to whom the publication of this Doctrine was committed, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. and directed hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſoules to both theſe, as they had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. S. <hi>Peter</hi> aſcribes Repentance with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. not that thoſe two preachers differed in their judgements, or that either of theſe two graces were ſufficient alone by it ſelf, but rather to ſhew their near affinity, that they cannot be ſeparated, that the right and thorough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the one, is the performance of both. This is the Kings High-way: if you hope to compaſs Redemption, and ſalvation in any other way, you will certainly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Oh that you, the careleſs ſinners in Zion (for unto you I ſpeak all this while) would at length be rouzed by the ſound of this trumpet, to look out for deliverance by Chriſt, before the priſon doors be made ſo faſt upon you, that there will be no remedy, and to provoke you the more to a thing ſo neceſſary, conſider theſe Motives.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is no poſſibility of deliverance from ſinne, and the Curſe, by any other means. A redeemer you muſt have, or you are undone, and the redeemer muſt pay a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:121171:149"/> vaſte ſumme for your Redemption. This is done to your hand by Jeſus Chriſt, if you will accept it upon his termes: If you will not, I would aske, where will you finde a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer? Do you look for another to come? He that muſt do this work, muſt bear the Curſe for you: But where is the man, that can, or will undertake this? God hath found none in heaven or earth mighty enough to lay this help upon,<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.5.</note> but Jeſus Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath laid it upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19. and now there remaines no more ſacrifice for ſinne. There is no wiſedome, nor power in all the world, that can relieve or beſtead the ſinner, which will not ſubmit to this way of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou wilt not give way to Chriſt, to glorifie his mercie in reſcuing thee from the Curſe, and Condemnation, he will glorifie his Juſtice, in letting thee lie an accurſed priſoner for ever. If thou wilt ſeek the Lord, his hand will be upon thee for good: But if thou forſake him, his power, and his wrath will bee againſt thee, to thy ruine, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 8.22. If thou wilt not kiſs the Sonne, he will be angry, and thou ſhalt periſh in the way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. His taking the Curſe upon him, will not ſerve thy turne, to ſecure thee from the danger of it, unleſs thou wilt be perſwaded to come up to his termes, and heartily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, as thine onely Lord-Redeemer, will give a large commiſſion to it, to deſtroy thee without mercie. He that obeyes not the Sonne, the wrath of God abides on him,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:121171:149"/> 
                     <hi>John</hi> 3.36. and he will come with vengeance in his hands againſt them, that obey not the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now the Lord offers you this incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mercie, you have the render of it ſtill continued in the Miniſterie of the Word, and the Spirit is Still inviting, and beſeeching you to accept of this redemption, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation thereby. Oh then hearken to the motion, and yeild your ſelves forthwith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. For although you do not give a peremptory denial, yet if you ſit ſtill, and triffle, your hearts will be hardened, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7, 8. I know thy thoughts; thou takeſt it for granted, that thou canſt come, and get a part in Chriſt, when thou pleaſeſt, but it is not ſo. It's eaſie to ſay, God be mercifull to me, and it is in thy power to preſume; but to repent, and to believe unfainedly, and in truth, thou ſhalt finde to be a work above thy ſtrength. I tell thee, thou bold ſinner, God will one day come near, and plead thus with thy conſcience, I gave thee Twenty, thirty, fortie yeares, and all that while my Spirit hath been wraſtling with thee, to draw thee to Chriſt, and thou ſayeſt, I can come at my pleaſure. If thou canſt, why haſt thou not come all this while. Seing therefore, thou haſt dallied with my grace, and rendred all my importunity and waiting void, and ineffectuall, thou ſhalt never enter into this bleſſed reſt of Redemption.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you have any true love to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, or any deſire of their welfare,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:121171:150"/> and comfort, then come in, and ſeek for a ſhare in this benefit, Wee are the ſervants of the Lord Jeſus, ſent forth to proclaim Redemption to the world. How would it glad our hearts, to ſee you all flocking in, as doves to the windowes, for your intereſt therein! that we may rejoyce in the day of Chriſt, and ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Behold, here am I, and the ſoules whom thou haſt ranſomed with thy blood, which have yielded themſelves to thee, through our Miniſtery. If you ſet light by this grace, and love the world, and the contentments of it better than Jeſus Chriſt, you break our hearts, and you will bring down our heads with ſhame, and ſorrow to the grave. But if you have no regard of us, yet, at leaſt pittie your ſelves. When the Lord of the whole world ſhall call us to give an account of our ſtewardſhip, and we ſhall be forced to give in this true evidence againſt you, Lord, we have ſtretched out our hands, all the day, all the year, all our life long, to a careleſs, and diſobedient people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. Our words came to their eares, but they would not ſuffer them to reach their hearts; Oh then! how can you lift up your heads? or whether will you flie for relief?</p>
                  <p>And now, I could heartily wiſh, that his word might follow you home, and the ſound of this trumpet grow more, and more ſhrill in your eares, till it hath awakened you tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly. Still remember, that it is a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the greateſt importance, requiring your choiceſt pains and diligence, if S. <hi>Auſtine</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:121171:150"/> ſaid truly, He that hath made thee without thee, will not ſave thee without the (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it of full ſavation, or the whole courſe of it, means as well as end) then may we ſay as truly, he that hath paid the price of thy redemption without thee, will not give thee the full poſſeſſion of it without thee. That which a man ſeeks, he may probably finde; if thou wilt beſtir thy ſelf in the uſe of means, there is hope that thou mayeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this mercy: But if thou ſleighteſt, and neglecteſt it, thou ſhalt be ſure to loſe it. As free a gift as it is, God will not drop it into your mouthes, while you ſnort and ſleep; if you think it not worth your moſt ſerious endeavours, you ſhall never bee better for it.</p>
                  <p>I have delivered mine errand, and I muſt leave it with you. Now adviſe, and ſee, what anſwer I ſhall return to him that ſent mee.</p>

Well, I will humbly hope, that I am one of that happy number. And that thou mayeſt be really happy in the perſonal poſſeſſion of this grace of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will give thee counſel, and God ſhall bee with thee. Take it in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Seriouſly ponder the weight and ſtrength of this great deſign. It is bottomed on the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:121171:151"/> everlaſting love of God, and managed by his admirable wiſdome. The ſpring from which it flows is love, and wiſdome carries it on from firſt to laſt. It is the good pleaſure of his will, founded on his everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that ſinners ſhould be delivered and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this way, and in none other. Hearken what the Lord ſaith to thee poor ſinner, I have given my Son to take upon him thy curſe, that thou mighteſt be freed from it: And here I give thee my faithful promiſe, that if thou wilt heartily accept him for thy Lord-redeemer, and reſign up thy ſelf unto him, thou ſhalt both be acquitted from all the miſchief which the curſe would bring upon thee, and moreover inſtated in all that righteouſneſs and glory, which he enjoyes as Mediator, and that by a ſure Covenant, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be forgotten; my word may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſecurity to thee, but if that will not ſerve, behold here are my ſeals [the Sacraments] viſible evidences of my well-meaning, which may put all out of queſtion. Oh then, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee bring thy heart to reſt ſatisfied in this, unleſs thou dareſt ſleight the Lords free love, or thinkeſt that thou canſt diſanull his eternal purpoſe, and reſiſt, or alter the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his will, and be wiſer than thy Maker, what may hinder but thou ſhouldeſt lay hold on this ſtrength, and make peace, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 27.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſuppoſe, thou art skared out of thine old prophane temper, and ſeeſt great need of plying the Throne of grace, a with ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:121171:152"/> for mercy, deliverance, pardon, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.<note place="margin">Pſal. 130.1.

And becauſe faith is the gift of God, and no man can Come to Chriſt unleſs the Father draw him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. therefore it behooves thee to bee importunate for this drawing power, to bring thee to Jeſus Chriſt, that thou mayeſt reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and be happy. And unto prayer, joyn other Ordinances, waiting on God in the uſe of them all in their ſeveral degrees, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, till the Spirit ſhall breathe a ſpark of faith into thy ſoul. Hearken not to thoſe, which bid thee lye ſtill,<note place="margin">Prov. 19.15</note> and wait, but do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; idle waiting may lull thee aſleep in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and lay thee open to deluſions and falſe hallowS concerning thy ſpiritual condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may tend to thy undoing, but it is not the way wherein the Spirit of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to draw near to the ſoul of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſinner.

                  <p n="3">3. While thou art thus ſighing towards heaven, and begging faith to be ranſomed,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:121171:152"/> and freed from thy ſore bondage, be careful to learn ſelf-denial, trampling under-foot, not onely thine own righteouſneſs (which I preſume, thou doſt already) but alſo wiſdome, reaſon, ſenſe, and whatſoever elſe may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily ſtop thy way, and keep thee off from Chriſt; and ſtill ever, and anon, be trying thy heart towards the acting of faith; do not ſit down in the ſullenneſs of thy ſpirit, ſaying, I do well to hold of, but ſtruggle with thy unbeleeving heart. Set thy foot upon this way, and lift up one foot after another, that at laſt thou mayeſt come to cloſe with thy Redeemer.

Stick at it no longer, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaping at difficulties, forthwith betake thy ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, and thou art actually ſet free.<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.9.10.</note> Let thy heart be convinced of righteouſneſs, as well as of ſin, that as thou haſt ſeen thy ſin powerfully working towards thy condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo thou mayeſt ſee, and gladly imbrace the righteouſneſſe of Chriſts Salvation, working as powerfully for thy acquittance and juſtification. Say, Lord, although I finde no encouragement either in my ſelf, or from the creature, to expect any good by the work of Redemption, yet ſeeing thou haſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly promiſed deliverance to all poor cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that will betake themſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, and give up themſelves to him by faith, behold here I am, I beleeve, help thou mine unbeleef, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24. hee ſhall have the

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To the former branch of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Divines have various apprehenſions concerning the extent of Redemption. The moſt received doctrine amongſt orthodox Writers (as I take it) is, that it is as narrow as Election and effectual vocation, that the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:121171:154"/> Lord did not intend, that the curſe and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, ſhould be paid as a price for the ranſoming of all, and every one, but only of thoſe, who were ſingularly deſigned in Gods eternal purpoſe according to Election to the injoyment of it, by effectual calling.</p>
                  <p>There be other two opinions, which hold an univerſality of Redemption, yet with a very great difference: The Arminians teach that Chriſt dyed for all alike, that by his death he obtained that all men ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored into the ſtate of grace and ſalvation, that Almighty God, did not will, or intend the redemption of any one more,<note place="margin">See <hi>Wards Conc ad Clerum,</hi> pag. 19.20.</note> or leſs than another, that both the price was paid for <hi>Judas,</hi> as well as for <hi>Peter,</hi> and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it (on Gods part) is equally for them both, not more for <hi>Peter</hi> than <hi>Judas;</hi> but the difference is made by themſelves, the one accepting, the other refuſing the grace tendered by the power of his own will. But this doctrine is to be rejected as falſe and dangerous. It doth clearly make void the grace of God, and exalt mans free will; lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him up into the ſeat of God, to be his own Redeemer; for (ſay they) when God hath put forth all thoſe workings of grace which he is wont to make uſe of in the way to converſion,<note place="margin">See Suffrag.

                     </note> both learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, judicious, and godly, which allow an univerſality of Redemption; and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their judgement thus, or to this effect: That Jeſus Chriſt, by the appointment of his Father, taking upon him the curſe due to ſin, did give himſelf a ſacrifice, and paid a price for the ranſome of all mankinde; yet not with an equal intention and reſolution for every one, but thus, Effectually to redeem, and perfectly to ſave all thoſe whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given him, that is the Elect, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying unto them his ſatisfaction and merits, and inabling them by his Spirit to perform the conditions of actual intereſt therein, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no ſuch purpoſe, or reſolution for all,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:121171:155"/> or any of the reſt of mankinde. So that Chriſt dyed for all in this ſenſe, that all, and every one may obtain actual deliverance and ſalvation thereby in caſe they do beleeve; but yet he dyed for the Elect onely in this ſenſe, that they through the merit of his death, which was ſpecially deſigned for them, might be brought infallibly both to faith, and to eternal life. The difference of this from the firſt, which limits even the paying of the price, to the Elect, is not ſo wide, as to give juſt cauſe to either party, to brand the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters with hereſie or ſchiſme; both of them having the letter of the Scriptures to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them: The former we may finde, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15. <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep,</hi> Act. 20.28. He hath purchaſed the Church of God with his own blood, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. &amp;c. He gave himſelf for the Church to ſanctifie and glorifie it: The latter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his Son,</hi> Joh. 4.42.

He taſted death for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. Neither am I ſo confident of the ſtrength of mine own judgement, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether of theſe, is the naked truth of God: For who am I, that I ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture profeſſedly to ſide with either party, againſt men of ſo great name and worth in the Churches of Chriſt? Onely (reſerving to my ſelf the liberty of mine own thoughts) I ſhall crave leave to minde you of three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:121171:155"/>1. I ſuppoſe, that this latter opinion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly be charged to wrong any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truth of Chriſtian Religion, or the Doctrine which is according to godlineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It ſeems the faireſt way to a right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of thoſe Texts before mentioned, which ſpeak different things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I am apt to think, that if both were laid together, and well weighed, they would be found to come near to a friendly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not to ſtand at ſo wide a diſtance, as ſome imagine; for both ſides do readily grant,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the ſatisfaction given by Chriſt is abundantly ſufficient for the redemption of the whole world, yea of ten thouſand worlds, it being the blood of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the offer of it is freely made to all the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> by the appointment of God in the miniſtry of the Goſpel, and therefore the Miniſters muſt both publiſh this grace to all, and exhort them to imbrace it, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is onely from a ſpecial diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating grace of God, that ſome ſinners are brought off to ſubmit to Gods termes, while others refuſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That onely the Elect are effectually wrought thus to ſubmit, and to accept of Chriſt offered, and ſo are actually redeemed, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That all the reſt of the world, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this effectual grace vouchſafed them, but being left unto themſelves, do refuſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:121171:156"/> and ſalvation offered,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.24 &amp; 15.22.</note> and ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their ſins juſtly through their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37.38.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to diſmiſs this diſcourſe: I anſwer to the latter branch of the Objection thus: Neither of the Opinions named, will bear ſuch a Concluſion. It is but a weak kinde of Logick to argue thus. Chriſt did not intend to pay a price for the ranſoming of every ſinner, and therefore it may not be of me; or thus, he did not intend to apply this ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to every one for his actual Redemption, therefore perhaps he meant, it not to me. This is abſurd, and unreaſonable reaſoning: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Why mayeſt thou not as well ſay, It may be, he doth graciouſly intend it for me? ſeeing thou canſt not plead any unworthineſs, or uncapableneſs againſt thy ſelf, which may not bee as juſt a bar againſt all others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou haſt an offer of this benefit made to thee every day, and thou art invited to entertain it? Wilt thou now ſtand off and ſay, I cannot tell whether it be intended for me, or no? If a Creditor ſhall ſay to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned Debtor, Come forth, for thy debt is paid, and I am ſatisfied, what a folly were it to anſwer thus. It may be, my debt is not diſcharged, I know not whether thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt my liberty. No, rather wave this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and cloſe with his offer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The onely way to put the matter out of doubt, is this, Apply thy ſelf in the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent uſe of Gods Ordinances, to the ſerious
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:121171:156"/> and ſincere performance of the condition, and reſt not till thy heart be drawn off from all other things, to repoſe it ſelf on him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Although (I ſuppoſe) we may ſafely conclude, that every childe of <hi>Adam,</hi> even continuing in his ſinful eſtate, may lawfully take it for granted, that Chriſt became a curſe to buy him out from the curſe, that is, that he gave himſelf a ranſome for all men, and therefore for him alſo, for ought he knows to the contrary; and that he may, and certainly ſhall be partaker of the fruit thereof, if he ſubmit to the Lords termes (for otherwiſe what ground have I to make, or he to take the offer of Chriſt) yet for all that, we may not ſay, that any ſinner continuing under the obedience of ſin, that is, that he hath a preſent intereſt in Redemption, or is actually partaker of it; for this implies a contradiction, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.34. A ſervant of ſin (while ſuch) cannot be the Lords free man; nay rather he ought to be perſwaded of the contrary. But as for thee, poor ſenſible humbled ſoul, thou mayeſt groundedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that thou art one of the Lords Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; this is thy priviledge, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it is thy duty, by the daily acting of faith on Chriſt, and the conſtant exerciſe of all other graces, to endeavour after a full aſſurance thereof in thy ſoul; and in the mean time to ſtay thy ſelf on the Lord, and his ſure word for the accompliſhment.</p>

If you can make it ſure to me, that God hath not caſt me out by an eternal Decree, but hath appointed me to ſalvation, then I ſhall have ſome courage in the uſing of any means, and taking any pains for attaining that end: But if I be none of that number, then I have nothing to do with Redemption, and all my labour of beleeving and repenting, and doing good will be loſt, and I ſhall runne in vain.</p>

                  <p>But then 2. Hence to infer, that it is no matter what a man doth, or how he walks, is a wicked and dangerous concluſion; for the Decreee of Predeſtination, hath made a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary connexion, betwixt the means, and the end; but that godleſs inference, breaks this golden chain all to peeces. To live in ignorance, ſecurity, unbeleef, diſobedience is the ready way to hell, and conſequently a fearful mark of Reprobation. To neglect
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:121171:157"/> means of ſaving knowledge, faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and new obedience, is to forfeit ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and to declare thy ſelf to be none of Gods Elect.</p>

                  <p>The application is eaſie. To walk in the ſtate and wayes of ſin, or to avoid the way of faith and holineſs, out of a conceit or fear that thou art not in the number of the Elect, is damnable madneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a groundleſs ſuppoſition, to ſay, If I be not elected, all my labour of beleeving, repenting, and holy walking will be loſt; for it implies, that a man may do all theſe, and yet be damned. But this is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent

                  <p n="4">4. No man in the world can give thee an infallible aſſurance of thy election immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, neither oughteſt thou to ſeek for ſuch aſſurance. Scripture and reaſon both will tell thee, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But then take heed, that thou ſuſpend not this upon the certain knowledge of thine election; ſay not, I will firſt know that I am elected, before I take pains in the way to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; If the King ſhould grant a pardon to a hundred Traytors, whoſe names are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in the Exchequer, upon certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to be performed by them, expreſſed in a Proclamation, it would be a fooliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous courſe, firſt to ſearch the Rolls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they look after the performance of the conditions; no, they muſt firſt do this, and then ſue out their pardon: Even ſo, thy way to heaven, is not firſt to climbe up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſearch the Records, whether thy name be there, the word is near thee even in thine heart; Say not, who ſhall go up to

What can be more eaſie, than to do a work, the ſtreſs whereof lies upon another hand, not on thine? It's true, of thy ſelf thou art no more able to believe, than to keep the whole Law, (for the dead man can ſtirre his right hand, no more then his left): but the Goſpel, or Covenant of grace affords ſtrength to believe, whereas the Law, or Covenant of works affords none at all to obey:<note place="margin">Ier. 31.37, Heb. 8.6, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:121171:168"/> that too many of the Lords ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed ones ſpend their dayes in ſorrow, lowrneſs, and dejection of ſpirit, Whereas they ſhould rather give up themſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him, who hath plucked their feet out of the net.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hold faſt the Libertie, which Chriſt hath given you, Seing you are now ſet free, inſlave not your ſelves again, unto a ſecond bondage, which may be,</p>

When thou haſt entertained this truth of Redemption, by Chriſt, and haſt gone ſo farre in applying it to thy ſelf, that thou dareſt claim a part in it, beware now of backſliding, that thou leave not Chriſt on the plain field, in caſting off the truth, and abandoning the profeſſion of it, before men. If thou draweſt back, the Lord will have no pleaſure in thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. Let theſe terrible thunderclaps be ever in thine eares, that thoſe which fall away, cannot be renewed unto repentance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, &amp;c. That if we ſinne willingly, by a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Apoſtaſie from the truth received, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſinnes, but an expectation of Judgement, and fierie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27.

                  <p n="2">2. More covert or refined, and that either of conſcience, or of converſation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Bondage of conſcience is when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ſoule gives way to the threats, and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:121171:168"/> terrours of the Law, and ſuffers them to get ſo farre within him, as they cauſe him in ſome degree to lie down under the power of them. Yield not to this ſlaverie, Onely know, and make account that every ſinne is in it ſelf of ſuch a malignant quality, that it would certainly bring the curſe, and wrath of God upon thee, If it were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: And therefore when thou art overtaken with it, thou muſt judge thy ſelf worthy to be deſtroyed, and that the Lord might juſtly charge it upon thee, and follow the Law againſt thee, to thy condemnation; and hereupon it will be neceſſary, that thou be often renewing thy repentance, in Godly ſorrow, with faith on the Redeemer for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and fencing thy ſoul more againſt thy ſinne, by hatred of it, and reſolution againſt it. Do all this and ſpare not; but let not the Law throw the fire-balls of hell into thy conſcience. Look not on thy ſelf as one that lies under the Curſe, Thy Redeemer hath cleared the ſcore, and diſanulled the Law, as to the Curſe of it, ſo that, it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt thee. This lyon may roar upon thee, but be not diſmayed, the Lord hath ſent the Angel of the Covenant, and hath ſhut the Lyon's mouth, his,<note place="margin">Dan. 6.22.</note> rage is abated, his undoing power is taken away, he may ſhew his teeth, and ſnatch at thee, but he cannot wound thee mortally. Thou haſt now a juſt and clear ground to go upon, in anſwering all the demands, pleeas and accuſations that can lie againſt thee in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:121171:169"/> God's high Court of Juſtice. Therefore doe not nouriſh Legal feares any longer, but turn the Curſe over to thy Redeemer, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell it, that it hath nothing to do with thee. The Apoſtle in telling the believers of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they had not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that ſuch a condition (to be held down under the ſlaviſh fear of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) doth not well conſiſt with the eſtate of the Redeemed ſonnes of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Bondage of converſation, when a ſinner having hearkened to the Call and counſel of the Goſpel, in accepting the offer of Chriſt, and redemption by him, gives leave to the bodie of ſinne, dwelling in him, to act its part too much, and to bring him into ſome degrees of willing bondage, under thoſe luſts, or ſinfull practiſes, which formerly he had eſcaped and relinquiſhed. Doſt thou chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a ſhare in this ranſome? Oh, then do not enſlave thy ſelf again unto any ſinne; Art thou fetch'd out of the houſe of ſpiritual bondage with a mightie hand? Take heed, that thou hanker not after the fleſh pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or attempt a return thither, as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.4. Hath the Lord ſpoken peace to thee? wilt thou then turne again to folly? God forbid. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. Oh! alas, that any of us ſhould (after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the profeſſion of Chriſt, for ſome conſiderable time) ſuffer our ſelves to be enſnared in our olde luſts, or fall into new wayes of ſinne, which yet is the ſad caſe of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:121171:169"/> ſome, who at their entrance gave hopes of better things. Jeſus Chriſt that mightie Champion, hath caſt the Curſe of the Law on a dead ſleep. If thou wilt give libertie to thy ſelf, to commit iniquitie, or to trade in any forbidden way, thou mayeſt fear, that the noiſe of thy ſinne will awake this fierce Lion, ere thou be aware, to tear thy ſoul in pieces. Hearken to the Apoſtle's counſel; Faſhion not your ſelves according to your former luſts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. If the Manſlayer, having fled to the city of Refuge, would afterwards make bold to wander without the border of it, the Avenger of blood, finde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, might lawfully kill him, his blood muſt be on his own head, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.26. &amp;c. Even ſo, if thou haſt once betaken thy ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt as thy refuge, and after that, ſtraggleſt out of his liberties, into any ſinfull practiſe, thou art then within the reach of the Avenger of blood, the Curſe may meet with thee, and ſlay thy ſoul. Thy Redeemer hath hedged thee out from all ſuch baſe courſes, as are contrary to the end of thy Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If thou wilt take Libertie, where he gives none, at thy peril be it. The beſt, thou canſt expect, is that when he comes, he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and ſay, Alas, what profit is there in my blood, that I have gone down to the pit, to deliver thee out of it, ſeing thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thither again? Be adviſed then, thou ranſomed Chriſtian, to lay a ſtrict injunction upon thy ſelf, and ſay, O my ſoul, thou art now ſet free, ſinne no more, leaſt a worſe

Reſigne your ſelves to him, to be at his appointment, and to his glorie. So doth the Apoſtle exhort, from this very ground, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. The Lord Jeſus having paid thy ranſome, and made thee a freeman from the Curſe, challengeth thee now for his own, and ſaith, Thou art mine: It is thy part, to Eccho, and ſay, Lord, I am thine, and to dedicate thy ſelf to him, with full purpoſe of heart, in the whole ſtream of thy converſation: and that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In doing. Iſraels deliverance from Egyptian bondage, was an ingagement to obedience.

Chriſt died, and roſe again, that he might be Lord of quick, and dead, therefore whether we live, or die, it muſt be, not to our ſelves, but to him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8, 9. Thoſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:121171:170"/> that are redeemed, to be Chriſt's peculiar people, muſt be zealous of good works,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15, 18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. Chriſt hath ſuffered, that we being made partakers of the benefit of his ſufferings, might live all our time after the will of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, 2. It was no part of our Redeemer's buſineſs, to free us from obedience, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by adding this engagement of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to that of Creation, to make the bond more ſtrong, that a two-fold cord might not be eaſily broken. We are too carnally ſelfiſh, If we think that Chriſt had no aim in this great work, but onely to deliver us from hell, and bring us to heaven. Doubtleſs he had a further end in his eye, even to reduce us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our firſt ſubjection, and obedience (from which we had wickedly departed), with the advantage of better abilitie to ſerve him, that we might be to his glory.

So that, the Law ceaſeth to condemne, but not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; It is no longer a curſe to deſtroy us, yet it is ſtill a Rule to direct us. It's ſtrange, that ſome men either cannot, or will not ſee, a clear difference, betwixt the mark, or finger which ſhews the way to the Traveller,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:121171:171"/> and the ſtrength of body, whereby he is enabled to go on in the way; betwixt the command of the Law, which preſcribes us our work, and the grace of the Spirit, which gives us power to do it: The Spirit, and the Letter are not oppoſite, but ſweetly ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.6.</note> The oppoſition is onely betwixt the newneſs of the ſpirit, and the oldneſs of the Letter; That ſervice which we before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as ſlaves, we now performe as ſonnes, Chriſt makes a change in us, in relation to the Rule, but no change in the matter of the Rule it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In Suffering. Chriſt hath undergone hard meaſures for thy ſake, and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by purchaſed thy freedome. Be thou willing to undergo hard meaſures for his ſake, that thou mayeſt advance his honour. If thou haſt taſted the bitterneſs of thy bondage, and the ſweetneſs of Redemption, thou wilt not grudge to lay down, all thy worldly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the feet of thy Redeemer, yea, thou wilt not refuſe to put thy life in thy hands, and to be ſacrificed for the promoting of his glory, and be thankfull that thou art thought worthie to ſuffer for his Name. Yea, more,<note place="margin">Acts 5.41.

And oh, that we could thus farre deny our ſelves for the honour of him, who hath denied himſelf infinitely more for us.</p>
                  <p>Conclude then for certain, that the Lord's Redeemed ought to reſigne themſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the will, and ſervice of Jeſus Chriſt, their Lord, The equitie (yea neceſſitie) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may further appear, if ye minde theſe few motives.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He onely hath the right of proprietie in you. The ranſomed Captive is not his own, to diſpoſe of himſelf; nor can any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon claim an intereſt in him, to require ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of him, ſave onely he, that hath paid the price of his Redemption: Even ſo, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy ſelf, nor Sathan, nor the world, but onely Jeſus Chriſt hath the unqueſtionable title of dominion over thee, to order and to rule thee, ſo that thou art no debtor, to live, either to thy ſelf, or to them, but to him,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:121171:172"/> that died for thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. The Sacrament of baptiſme holds forth this leſſon. Thou waſt baptiſed into the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and hereby art really engaged unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. To withdraw thy ſelf from his ſervice, and betake thy ſelf to other Lords, is an high degree of theft, and Covenant-breaking. The Prophet ſpeaks of witholding Tithes, and Offerings, as of a ſtrange unheard of kinde of robbery. Will a man rob God? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. What unreaſonable brutiſhneſs is this?<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> What is it then for a Chriſtian to rob God of himſelf, and his reaſonable ſervice? Shall the pettie Thieves be ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the grand Robbers eſcape? Reſolve then, and ſay, Lord, other Lords beſides thee have had dominion over us, but now we diſclaim them, and we will remember thy name onely, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſafety and comfort of your ſtanding all along in this pilgrimage here below, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend very much upon this. If you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake your ſelves, and all other Lords, and referre your ſelves to the guidance, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Jeſus Chriſt, you need not fear any hard meaſures from him, in whom there is no unrighteouſneſs; you may truſt him, he will ſee,<note place="margin">Pſal. 92.15.</note> that you ſhall fare no worſe for that, but better.

                     </gap> in ſmaller dangers. This is the way to ſecure your own peace and happineſs, if, having owned Chriſt by faith, for your alone Redeemer, you will yield up your
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:121171:172"/> ſelves to him, in unreſerved obedience, in every condition, to do and ſuffer according to his will. But if you will needs be your own maſters, or put your ſelves under the command of other Lords, you do hereby diſcharge him from taking care of you, and expoſe your ſelves to infinite perils. Thou, that hopeſt thou haſt an actual ſhare in this benefit, and yet either refuſeſt to live wholly to him, or elſe doſt capitulate with him, and wilt have a vote in the managing of thine own wayes, thou mayeſt fear, that God will give thee up to follow thine own counſels, and to ſhift for thy ſelf in all the ſtormes, which thou mayeſt meet withall. And woe to that poor creature, whom God doth leave to himſelf, and to his own carvings; he muſt needs be in a very tottering condition, farre from peace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the great day of reckoning which is to come, Chriſt the Redeemer ſhall be judge: for the Father hath committed this buſineſs unto him, and hath given aſſurance thereof, in that, after his ſad conflicts with the Curſe, and death, he raiſed him up a Conquerour, <hi>Acts.</hi> 17.31. Now in that great Aſſize, Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be made among thoſe which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers to Jeſus Chriſt, chiefly concerning 2 things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether haſt thou, in the ſence of thy wofull bondage under the Curſe of the Law, heartily accepted of Chriſt offered in the Goſpel, and renouncing all other helps in thy ſelf, or the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:121171:173"/> reſted on him, as thine onely Redeemer?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether haſt thou willingly reſigned thy ſelf up to him, as thy ſoveraigne Lord, to rule, and order thee in thy whole conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſo as thy main ſtudy, and work hath been to minde, and to ſeek his intereſt, to live to him, and to die to him, and ſo to be intirely for him, and for his glory.</p>
                  <p>This Latter ſhall then be inſiſted on, and put home,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.35, 42, &amp;c.</note> to trie the truth of the former. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concernes you, to bethink your ſelves before hand, what anſwer you will make, when you ſhall ſtand before the judge. If your hearts tell you, that you have onely given Chriſt good words, calling him, Lord, Lord, but have not made conſcience of coming up to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes, or yielding obedience to his will, or ſubmitting to his pleaſure, and diſpoſing hand in all things, Oh, what a black day will that be, when you ſhall not be able to lift up your faces before him, but muſt ſtand ſpeechleſs? Then ſhall you be ſenſible of your deſperate folly, and condemne your ſelves for it, ſadly lamenting, that you have ſo groſly neglected both your Redeemer, and your own ſoules: but all too late, your day will be paſt. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that man,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.14.</note> that ſhall then be found of him in peace, without ſpot, and blameleſs, although his lot ſhould be to live in beggerie, and miſery in this world, all the dayes of his appointed time.</p>
                  <p>Yet alas, what a wofull guilt lies on the conſciences of too many Chriſtians? We all confeſs with our mouthes, Chriſt's authority
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:121171:173"/> over us by the right of Redemption, but how few of us make any proof thereof by ſuitable obedience. The moſt have given up themſelves to ſeek the intereſts of the fleſh, and the world; their deſires, deſignes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, imployments, delights, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, run wholly in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He bids us be holy, be ſober, and watch, deny our ſelves, take up our croſs, love our enemies, have our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in heaven, ſeek things above, crucifie the fleſh, walk in newneſs of life, grow in grace, and the knowledge of Chriſt, &amp;c. But theſe are ſtrange things to many of us, which challenge a part in the grace of Redemption, and yet walk contrary, denying Chriſt his right, making proviſion for the fleſh, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving our lives to the luſts and pleaſures of this world.

I would gladly

                  <p n="1">1. Miniſters of the Goſpel. We are Chriſts Heraulds ſent forth to proclaime deliverance to the Captives, and to perſwade them to imbrace it;<note place="margin">Lev. 25 9, 10</note> even as one part of the Prieſts office was by ſound of Trumpet to give publick notice of the year of Jubilee, and to prepare the people for the injoying the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of it. Our work is very important, therefore it behoves us to be very faithful, and diligent in it. We have many under our over-ſight (alas, too many) which lye in the bond of iniquity, ſtrangers to Jeſus Chriſt. Our maine buſineſs is in reference to theſe, that we may turn them from the power of Satan unto God, and bring them to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of true ſpiritual liberty by Jeſus Chriſt. Wee may look upon thoſe truely miſerable ſoules, as the ruful objects of our choiſeſt pity, and we ought by all due means, eſpecially by publick preaching, and private inſtruction, to labour their converſion, and to ſave them from dropping into thoſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings. See the grave counſel of the Apoſtle to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, 26. And here we muſt have a ſpecial eye upon thoſe whom we perceive to be awakened, to look out toward a change. When the Lord ſends to us any poor ſouls that are ſtruck down by the Miniſtry unto conviction, and humiliation, he doth then call us, to hold forth ſuch ſpiritual direction and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

When the Lord appointed Cities of Refuge for the man-ſlayer, he gave charge, that a way ſhould be prepared, and the coaſts of the Land divided into three parts.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems this diviſion was in favour of the perſons, that every one might take the benefit of the neareſt City, leſt the length of the way might occaſion danger, <hi>Deu.</hi> 19.3, 6. And when the Lord promiſeth to bring in his people by the cal of the Goſpel (which may poſſibly refer to the calling of the Jews) he bids, <hi>Caſt up, caſt up, prepare the way of my people, gather out the ſtones, take up the ſtumbling-blocks,</hi> Iſa. 57.14. &amp; 62.10. which expreſſions ſeem to allude to the preparing of the way to the City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. This burden lyes chiefly on us Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, as it appears by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie concerning <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Iſa. 40.3, 4. Matth. 3.3. It is one part of our Office to make the way plain, that no rub may lye in it to hinder guilty diſtreſſed ſouls in their march towards their only Refuge Chriſt Jeſus. And after all this, we have variety of work in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to you, which are actually redeemed, to ſtabliſh you in the preſent truth, to fence you againſt errors, temptations, corruptions, to build you up in knowledge, faith, holineſs, and ſo to bring you on unto perfection. The charge of the holy Apoſtle is very punctual and full, <hi>Take heed to all the flocke, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 20.28. I would awake my ſelf, and my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and thus be-ſpeak my ſelf, Oh theſe

Hath he undergone the curſe to ſet them free from it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to improve my uttermoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to bring them to the enjoyment of this benefit, and ſhall I ſuffer them to continue in that woful priſon, and to periſh eternally, through my ſilence and unfaithfulneſs? God forbid! Let us conſider before-hand, how ſad it will be, if at the great day, our Maſter Chriſt ſhall bring forth his curſe, blood, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and ſet before our eyes the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of poor ſouls, to plead againſt us for our negligence, and to aggravate our juſt condemnation, when there will be no place for repentance.</p>

He had no doubt of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but made full account, that he would command his children, and his houſhold thus to do, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. and if thou be a right-bred childe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> thou wilt follow his ſteps. Certainly this great work of Redemption from the curſe, is one of the chiefe of Gods wayes; therefore yee ſhould
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:121171:176"/> ſee, that they keep this way eſpecially, uſing all means to bring them to the knowledge and love, and ſo to the perſonal injoyment of it in due time. Go to then.

If thou haſt any love to her ſoul, thou wilt pitty, exhort, pray for her, and ſay, Alas, alas, for the wife that lyes in my boſome; for ought I can perceive, ſhe is ſtill under the curſe of the Law, her great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and uncapableneſs, her unſavourineſs, and coldneſs, yea her averſneſs, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs in matters of godlineſs, eſpecially where it moſt concerns her own ſpiritual good, do even proclaime it aloud, to my griefe. Oh that the Lord would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on her, that at laſt I might ſee her partaker of the bleſſing. Thou art a Father, or mother, you that are ſuch, may look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your children with weeping eyes, while you ſee them chained in the bolts, and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the curſe, and conſider withall, that you were means to bring them into this bondage, and that they are your bone, and your fleſh, a part of your ſelves. Oh then, if you have the bowels of Parents, help them at this dead lift. Will you turn every ſtone to provide large portions for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and will you do nothing in the mean time for their ſoules? If they were in priſon for debt, or upon any other account, you could not finde in your hearts, that they ſhould lye there ſtill, but you will try all
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:121171:177"/> wayes to procure their liberty, and can you be content to ſee them lye under the curſe in the dungeon of hell, for want of ſhare in this Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Thou art a Maſter or Dame. Look upon your man-ſervants and maid-ſervants. Are they not ſervants of ſin, ſlaves to luſts and divers pleaſures? Addicted to vain conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, as in the prophaning, and miſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords day? And ſo ſtrangers to Jeſus Chriſt, and heires of the Curſe? Oh pitty their ſoules, and do what you can by prayer, and good counſel, to recover them out of the gall of bitterneſs. It may be, thou canſt ſay truly, they are good ſervants to me, they do my work faithfully, I cannot blame them: But what doth this avail, while thou mayeſt ſay as truly, that they are deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to the ſervice of Satan, and aliens to the grace of Redemption? my ſoul bleeds for their ignorance, and obſtinacy. Oh that I might ſee my ſervants to become at length the ſervants of the Lord Jeſus. But where ſhall we finde ſuch governours of Families? one City, or two in a tribe, ſo few that a little childe may count them. If the wiſe be provident, frugal, helpful towards the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of the eſtate; if the children be dutiful, apt to learn that, which may be their livelihood hereafter, only keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free from ſuch courſes as may ruine them, or expoſe them to ſhame: If the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be ſtrong to labour, and bring in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by their diligence: The Husbands,

Oh Chriſtians, death may well be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch, as are ſtrangers to Chriſt; but he hath taken away the ſting of it for you: Therefore labour to get up above your feares, and be freely content to be unclothed, that you may be preſent with the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 8.</p>

LAſtly, I would improve this Truth by way of Admonition, and from this, as a new ground, briefly whet upon your hearts, that inference, which I drew from the firſt Concluſion, concerning Curſing, that it is both irrational, and irreligious. So ſhall the juſt condemnation of that wicked practiſe be eſtabliſhed in the mouth of two approved witneſſes.<note place="margin">Deut. 17.6.</note> As it is madneſs, to wiſh a curſe to our ſelves, or others, ſeeing we are all under the ſtroak of it by nature: So truly it is a double madneſs to do it, now that we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from it by grace. Your own reaſon may diſſwade you from it on the former ground, unleſs you be ſo deſperate as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill under the curſe, and to implunge your ſelves deeper into the gulf, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may take you off on the latter ground, unleſs you will reſolve thus, Chriſt indeed hath delivered ſinners from the Curſe, but we are content to tamper with it ſtill, and ſo make your ſelves a thouſand times more the children of wrath than you were before. Yet alas, how common is this miſcarriage, even among them, that profeſs themſelves to be redeemed by Chriſt? It is too uſual with ſome men, to wiſh a curſe to their own ſouls, thereby either to confirm the truth of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or to binde themſelves to do that,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:121171:184"/> which they have purpoſed in their hearts to do. It is true, we have examples of the beſt men in Scripture, which have ſo done, as <hi>Job</hi> chap. 31.7, 8. &amp;c. and <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 7.3, 4, 5. but theſe were for the moſt part rather ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated than voluntary, for the clearing of their innocency, alwayes adviſed, and weighty, with ſolemn reverence in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, from whom they did certainly expect the accompliſhment of their wiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, in caſe they ſhould bee found faulty. And thus they may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, being uſed very ſparingly. But this cannot juſtifie the too frequent uſe of them, without neceſſity, upon trivial occaſions, raſhly, headily, brutiſhly, when the fear of God in the heart doth not manage the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to render it accepted. As for the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and banning of others; Oh how rife is it! How eaſily do the common people fall into that baſe language? If they be but a little provoked, if paſſion get the upper hand in a ſmall meaſure, their tongues are forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all on a flame in bitter imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>It is true alſo that ſome holy, men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in Scripture to have curſed others, It is commanded, <hi>Jud.</hi> 5.23. It was practiſed by <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 69.22. &amp;c. By <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 King. 2.24. By <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> chap. 13.25. and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> chap. 18.20, 21. But theſe are meerly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, being predictions of evill againſt others, uttered by the Spirit of Propheſie, which cannot warrant us to do the like.</p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:121171:185"/>
               <p>And I ſuppoſe, we ſhall ſcarcely meet with one approved example in the Book of God, which will bear us out in the curſing of others. <hi>Jobs</hi> and <hi>Jeremies</hi> curſing the day of their birth, and the man that firſt brought tidings of it, with the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of inordinate paſſion, in no caſe to be looked on as preſidents.</p>
               <p>And ſome have a Curſe <hi>[Ah, fie upon him]</hi> ready on a ſhort warning to fling at a godly man, even becauſe he is godly, as if the Lords Redeemed, were the proper marks at which theſe ſharp arrows ſhould be ſhot. Oh moſt abominable Bedlam-practice! If you love your ſouls, beware of it. Conſider theſe motives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such language is the breathing, and framing of the Angel of the bottomleſs pit, it is the Dialect of hell, fit for none but blinde heathens, ſtrangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſuch as <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.43. or for prophane, hardened ſinners, which give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to all iniquity, and profeſſedly hate the righteous, as <hi>Shimei,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5, 7. Would ye not be in an higher form then theſe are? Can ye be content to be ſo far from the very ſuburbs of heaven?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſentence is paſſed long ago, and ſhall never be reverſed: Curſed is he that curſeth the people of God. It is the Lords own doom, though it was delivered by the mouth of <hi>Balaam</hi> the falſe Prophet, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.9. he was hired on purpoſe to curſe <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and came with a minde free enough to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:121171:185"/> do it, but the Lord turnes him aſide from his own byas, puts words of bleſſing into his mouth which he never thought of, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him againſt the bent of his own heart to pronounce thoſe accurſed that curſe <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And now dares any of you adventure upon a practiſe, which will be ſo far from taking the curſe from off your ſelves, that it will ſeal you more ſurely under the power of it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a very groſs, and dangerous taking Gods Name in vain, which may appear thus. Every bleſſing and curſe is virtually a prayer. As praying to God to do ſome good thing for our ſelves or others, is a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent uſing of his Name, becauſe it is a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning for that, which he hath promiſed to do; ſo on the contrary, praying for ſome evill to befall another, is a taking of it in vain, becauſe it is a petitioning for that, which he hath reſolved not to do, or at leaſt hath given no intimation of his purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, which may be our warrant for ſuch a prayer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It carries along with it apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and that in an high degree; for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men are bleſſed men: So the Lord tells <hi>Balaam,</hi> and upon that ground forbids him to curſe his people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.12. Hereby thou wrongeſt God himſelf, giving him the lye, oppoſing him in his way, and undoing what he hath done; and them alſo in bearing falſe witneſs againſt them, and repreſenting them to the Lord in the moſt odious poſture.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:121171:186"/> If a man ſhould be ſpread before a great Prince ſome falſe accuſations concerning his favourite, thereby to incenſe the Prince againſt him, what an injury were this to them both? Surely curſing the godly is a greater injury both to God, and them.</p>
               <p>If then thou doſt not like to bear the black brand of an unrighteous man, reſolve againſt this wickedneſs in the language, which God himſelf put into the mouth of <hi>Balaam, How ſhall I curſe, whom God hath not curſed? or deteſt whom he hath not deteſted?</hi> Num. 23.8.</p>
               <p>But truly, ſnarling Dogs will bark, and bite too, if they can, and the children of <hi>Belial</hi> will tear us with Curſes: Who can hinder them? And we may obſerve, that ſome mens tongues are ſo ſet on fire of hell, they are ſo full of the poyſon of Aſpes, and are ſo deſperately tranſported beyond all reaſon, that the very expreſſions are able to make the hearts of moderate men to tremble.</p>
               <p>Indeed the diſhonour of God, and the danger of their ſouls may give us cauſe to mourn, but they need not trouble us, on any other account.</p>
               <p>For firſt, they are cauſeleſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.2. Godlineſs is no juſt cauſe of curſing, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of bleſſing; the Lords Redeemed, are not Buts for ſuch poyſoned arrows, the perſons are miſtaken, ſuch curſes are like Birds which flye at rovers, aiming at no ſet place,
